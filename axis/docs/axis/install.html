      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This document describes how to install Apache Axis. It assumes
      you already know how to write and run Java code and not be scared
      of XML. You should also have an application server or servlet
      engine and be familiar with operating and deploying to it. If you
      need an application server, we recommend <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Jakarta Tomcat</a>. [If
      you are installing Tomcat, get the latest 4.1.x version, and the
      full distribution, not the LE version for Java 1.4, as that omits
      the Xerces XML parser]. Other servlet engines are supported,
      provided they implement version 2.2 or greater of the servlet API.
      Note also that Axis client and server requires Java 1.3 or later.
      
      <p>For more details on using Axis, please see the 
      <a href="user-guide.html">user guide</a>.
        
     <h2>Things you have to Know </h2>
     
     A lot of problems with Axis are encountered by people who are new
     to Java, Server-side Java and SOAP. While you can learn about SOAP
     as you go along, writing Axis clients and serves is not the right
     time to be learning foundational Java concepts, such as what an
     array is, or foundation App server concepts such as how Servlets
     work, and the basics of the HTTP protocol. 
     <p>
     Things you need to know to begin to write a Web Service:
     <ol>
     
     <li> Core Java datatypes, classes and programming concepts.
     
     <li> What threads are, race conditions, thread safety and
     sychronization. 
     
     <li> What a classloader is, and what hierarchical classloaders are,
     or 'common causes of a ClassNotFoundException'.
     
     <li> How to diagnose trouble from exception traces, what a
     NullPointerException (NPE) and other common exceptions are, and how
     to fix them. 
     
     <li> What a web application is; what a servlet is, where classes,
     libraries and data go in a web application.
     
     <li> How to start your application server and deploy a web
     application on it.
     
     <li> What a network is, the core concepts of the IP protocol suite
     and the sockets API. Specifically, what is TCP/IP. 
     
     <li> What HTTP is. The core protocol and error codes, HTTP headers and
     perhaps the details of basic authentication.
     
     <li> What XML is. Not how to parse it or anything, just what
     constitutes well-formed and valid XML.
     
     </ol>
     
     Axis and SOAP depends on all these details. If you don't know them,
     Axis (or anyone else's Web Service middleware) is a dangerous place
     to learn. Sooner or later you will be forced to discover these
     details, and there are easier places to learn than Axis.  
     
     <p>
     
     If you are completely new to Java, we recommend you start off with
     things like the Java Tutorials on Sun's web sites, and perhaps a
     classic book like <a
     href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/">Thinking in Java</a>,
     until you have enough of a foundation to be able to work with
     Axis. It is also useful to have written a simple web application,
     as this will give you some knowledge of how HTTP works, and how
     Java application servers integrate with HTTP.
     
     <p>
     
     Be aware that there is a lot more to know to use Axis and SOAP
     effectively than the listing above. The other big area is "how to
     write internet scale distributed applications". Nobody knows how to
     do that properly yet, so that you have to learn by doing.  
     
     <h2>Step 0: Concepts</h2>
     
     Apache Axis is an Open Source SOAP server and client. SOAP is a
     mechanism for inter-application communication between systems
     written in arbitrary languages, across the Internet. SOAP usually
     exchanges messages over HTTP: the client POSTs a SOAP request, and
     receives either an HTTP error code or an HTTP success code and a
     SOAP response. Open Source means that you get the source, but that
     there is no formal support organisation to help you when things go
     wrong. 
     
     <p>
     
     SOAP messages are XML messages. These messages exchange structured
     information between SOAP systems. Messages consist of one or more
     SOAP elements inside an envelope, Headers and the SOAP Body.  
     SOAP has two syntaxes for describing the data in these elements,
     <i>Section 5</i>, which is a clear descendent of the XML RPC
     system, and <i>XML Schema</i>, which is the newer (and usually
     better) system. Axis handles the magic of converting Java objects
     to SOAP data when it sends it over the wire or receives results.
     SOAP Faults are sent by the server when something goes wrong; Again
     Axis converts these to Java exceptions. 
     
     <p>
     
     SOAP is intended to link disparate systems. It is not a mechanism
     to tightly bind Java programs written by the same team together. It
     can bind Java programs together, but not as tightly as RMI or
     Corba. If you try sending many Java objects that RMI would happily
     serialize, you will be disappointed at how badly Axis fails. This
     is by design: if Axis copied RMI and serialized Java objects to
     byte streams, you would be stuck to a particular version of Java
     everywhere.

     <p>     
     
     Axis implements the JAX-RPC API, one of the standard ways to program
     Java services. If you look at the specification and tutorials on
     Sun's web site, you will understand the API. If you code to the
     API, your programs will work with other implementations of the API,
     such as those by Sun and BEA. Axis also provides extension
     features, and many ways that extend the JAX-RPC API. You can use
     these to write better programs, ones that only work with Axis. But
     since Axis is free and you get the source, that should not matter. 
     
     <p>
     
     Axis is implemented in the JAR file <i>axis.jar</i>; implementing
     the JAX-RPC API declared in the JAR files <i>jaxrpc.jar</i> and
     <i>saaj.jar</i>. It needs various helper libraries, for logging,
     WSDL processing and introspection. All these files can be packaged
     into a web application, <i>axis.war</i>, that can be dropped into a
     servlet container. Axis ships with some sample SOAP services. You
     can add your own by adding new compiled classes to the Axis webapp
     registering them.
     </p>
     
     <p>
     Before you can do that, you have to install it and get it working.
     </p>
     
    <a name="webapp"/></a>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Preparing the webapp</h2>

    <p>
    Here we assume that you have a web server up and running on the 
    localhost, at port 8080. If your server is on a different port,
    replace references to 8080 to your own port number. 
    
    </p>
    
    <p>In your Application Server installation, you should find a
    directory into which web applications ("webapps") are to be placed.
    Into this directory copy the webapps/axis directory from the
    xml-axis distribution. You can actually name this directory anything
    you want, just be aware that the name you choose will form the basis
    for the URL by which clients will access your service. The rest of
    this document assumes that the default webapp name, "axis" has been
    used; rename these references if appropriate.

    <a name="depend"/></a>
    <h2>Step 2: setting up the libraries</h2>

    <p>In the Axis directory, you will find a WEB-INF sub-directory. 
    This directory contains some basic configuration information, but
    can also be used to contain the dependencies and web services you wish to
    deploy.</p>
    
    <p>
    Axis needs to have an XML parser in its classpath. If your
    application server or Java runtime does not make one visible to web applications,
    you need to download and add it. Java 1.4 includes the Crimson
    parser, so you <i>can</i> omit this stage, though the Axis team
    prefer Xerces.
    
    <p>
    
    To add an XML parser, acquire the JAXP 1.1 XML compliant parser of
    your choice. We recommend Xerces jars from the <a
    href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">xml-xerces
    distribution</a>, though others mostly work. Unless your JRE or app
    server has its own specific requirements, you can add the parser's
    libraries to axis/WEB-INF/lib. 
    
    
    <h3>Tomcat 4.x and Java 1.4</h3>
      Java 1.4 changed the rules as to to how packages beginning in java.* and
      javax.* get loaded. Specifically, they only get loaded from
      <i>endorsed</i> directories. jaxrpc.jar and saaj.jar contain javax
      packages, so may not get picked up. If happyaxis.jsp 
      (see below) cannot find the relevant packages, copy them 
      from axis/WEB-INF/lib to CATALINA_HOME/common/lib and restart Tomcat. 
    
    <a name="start"/></a>
    <h2>Step 3: starting the web server</h2>

    <p>This varies on a product-by-product basis. In many cases it is as
    simple as double clicking on a startup icon or running a command from
    the command line.</p>

    <a name="install-test"/></a>
    <h2>Step 4: Validate the Installation</h2>

    <p>
    After installing the web application and dependencies, you should
    make sure that the server is running the web application.
    <h3> Look for the start page </h3>
      Navigate to the start page of the webapp, usually
      <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/</a>,
      though of course the port may differ.<br>
      You should now see an Apache-Axis start page. If you do not, then
      the webapp is not actually installed, or the appserver is not running. 

    <h3>Validate Axis with happyaxis</h3>
      Follow the link <i>
      Validate the local installation's configuration</i><br>

      This will bring you to <i>happyaxis.jsp</i> a test page that
      verifies that needed and optional libraries are present. The URL
      for this will be something like

      <A
      href="http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp">
      http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp</A>

      <p>
      If any of the needed libraries are missing, Axis will not work.
      <br><b>You must not proceed until all needed libraries can be
      found, and this validation page is happy.</b> <br> Optional
      components are optional; install them as your need arises. If you
      see nothing but an internal server error and an exception trace,
      then you probably have multiple XML parsers on the classpath, and
      this is causing version confusion. Eliminate the extra parsers,
      restart the app server and try again. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>Look for some services</h3>

      <p>

      From the start page, select <i>View the list of deployed Web services</i>.
      This will list all registered Web Services, unless the servlet is configured
      not to do so. On this page, You should be able to click on <i>(wsdl)</i> for
      each deployed Web service to make sure that your web service is up and running.

      </p>
      <p>
      Note that the 'instant' JWS Web Services that Axis supports are
      not listed in this listing -so when you get to these services, as
      the user guide will, do not panic when the services are not
      listed. 
      </p>            
     
      <h3>Test a SOAP Endpoint</h3>
      
      Now it's time to test a service. Although SOAP 1.1 uses HTTP POST
      to submit an XML request to the <i>endpoint</i>, Axis also
      supports a crude HTTP GET access mechanism, which is useful for
      testing. First let's retrieve the version of Axis from the version
      endpoint, calling the <code>getVersion</code> method:
      
      <a
      href="http://localhost:8080/axis/services/Version?method=getVersion">
      http://localhost:8080/axis/services/Version?method=getVersion
      </a>
      This should return something like
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt; 
  &lt;soapenv:Envelope 
      xmlns:soapenv=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot; 
      xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
      xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
      &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
      &lt;getVersionResponse 
          soapenv:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
          &lt;getVersionReturn 
              xsi:type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;
              Apache Axis version: 1.1 Built on Apr 04, 2003 (01:30:37 PST)
          &lt;/getVersionReturn&gt; 
      &lt;/getVersionResponse&gt;
      &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
  &lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</pre>  
  The Axis version and build date may of course be different. 

    <h3>Test a JWS Endpoint</h3>
    
    Now let's test a JWS web service. Axis' JWS Web Services are java files
    you save into the axis webapp <i>anywhere but the WEB-INF tree</i>,
    giving them the .jws extension. When some requests the .jws file by
    giving its URL, it is compiled and executed. The user guide covers
    JWS pages in detail.
    
    <p>
    
    To test the JWS service, we make a request against a built in
    example, EchoHeaders.jws (look for this in the axis/ directory).
    <p>
    Point your browser at 
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/axis/EchoHeaders.jws?method=list">
    http://localhost:8080/axis/EchoHeaders.jws?method=list
    </a>.<p>
    This should return an XML listing of your application headers,
    such as 
<pre class="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt; 
&lt;soapenv:Envelope 
    xmlns:soapenv=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot; 
    xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
    &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
        &lt;listResponse 
            soapenv:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
            &lt;listReturn xsi:type=&quot;soapenc:Array&quot; 
                soapenc:arrayType=&quot;xsd:string[6]&quot; 
                xmlns:soapenc=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;accept:image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;accept-language:en-us&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;accept-encoding:gzip, deflate&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;user-agent:Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;host:localhost:8080&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;connection:Keep-Alive&lt;/item&gt; 
            &lt;/listReturn&gt;
        &lt;/listResponse&gt;
    &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;

</pre>
Again, the exact return values will be different, and you may need to
change URLs to correct host, port and webapp specifics. 

    <a name="websvc"/></a>
    <h2>Step 5: installing new Web Services</h2>

    <p>So far you have got Axis installed and working, now it is time to add
        your own Web Service.
     <p>
     The process here boils down to (1) get the classes and libraries of this
     new service into the axis WAR directory tree, (2) tell the AxisEngine about 
     the new file. The latter is done by submitting an XML deployment descriptor
     to the service via the Admin web service, which is usually done with the 
     AdminClient program or the &lt;axis-admin&gt; Ant task. Both of
     these do the same thing: run the Axis SOAP client to talk to the
     Axis adminstration service, which is of course a SOAP service in
     its own right. It's a special SOAP service in one regard -to stop
     random people from administrating your service it is restricted to
     local callers only (not remote access) and is password protected.
     There is a default password that the client knows; if you change it
     then you need to pass the new password to the client.
     </p>
     <p> 
     The first step is to add your code to the server.

      <p>In the WEB-INF directory, look for (or create) a &quot;classes&quot;
        directory (i.e. axis/WEB-INF/classes ). In this directory, copy the
        compiled Java classes you wish to install, being careful to 
        preserve the directory structure of the Java packages.
        
      <p>If your classes services are already packaged into JAR files, 
      feel free to drop them into the WEB-INF/lib directory instead. Also
      add any third party libraries you depend on into the same directory.</p>

      <p>
      After adding new classes or libraries to the Axis webapp, you must
      restart the webapp. This can be done by restarting your
      application server, or by using a server-specific mechanism to
      restart a specific webapp.

      <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If your web service uses
        the simple authorization handlers provided with xml-axis (this is actually
        <u>not</u> recommended as these are merely illustrations of how to write
        a handler than intended for production use), then you will need to copy
        the corresponding users.lst file into the WEB-INF directory.</p>

    <a name="deploy"/></a>
    <h2>Step 6: deploying your Web Service</h2>
    </table>

    <p>The various classes and JARs you have just set up implement your
    new Web Service. 
    What remains to be done is to tell Axis how to expose this web service.
    Axis takes a Web Service Deployment Descriptor, (a WSDD file), that
    describes in XML what the service is, what methods it exports and
    other aspects of the SOAP endpoint.
    <p>
    
    The users guide and reference guide cover these WSDD files; here we
    are going to use one from the Axis samples; the stock quote service.
    
    <h3>Classpath setup</h3>
    
    Add axis.jar, commons-discovery.jar, commons-logging.jar, jaxrpc.jar, saaj.jar,
          log4j-1.2.8.jar (or whatever is appropriate for your chosen logging implementation),
          and the XML parser jar file or files (e.g., xerces.jar) to your classpath.

    On windows, this is something like the following, though of course
    to fix it across the system in WinNT systems it is done through
    dialog boxes:          
<pre class="xml">
    set AXIS_HOME=c:\tomcat\webapps\axis
    set AXIS_LIB=%AXIS_HOME%\lib
    set AXISCLASSPATH=%AXIS_LIB%\axis.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\commons-discovery.jar;
          %AXIS_LIB%\commons-logging.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\jaxrpc.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\saaj.jar;
          %AXIS_LIB%\log4j-1.2.8.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\xml-apis.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\xercesImpl.jar
</pre>          
    Unix users have to do something similar:
<pre class="xml">
    set AXIS_HOME=/usr/tomcat/webapps/axis
    set AXIS_LIB=$AXIS_HOME/lib
    set AXISCLASSPATH=$AXIS_LIB/axis.jar:$AXIS_LIB/commons-discovery.jar:
          $AXIS_LIB/commons-logging.jar:$AXIS_LIB/jaxrpc.jar:$AXIS_LIB/saaj.jar:
          $AXIS_LIB/log4j-1.2.8.jar:$AXIS_LIB/xml-apis.jar:$AXIS_LIB/xercesImpl.jar
    export AXIS_HOME; export AXIS_LIB; export AXISCLASSPATH
</pre>          

      To use Axis client code, you can select the Axis classpath when invoking 
      Java by going
      
      <pre class="xml">java -cp "%AXISCLASSPATH%" ...</pre>
      or 
      <pre class="xml">java -cp "$AXISCLASSPATH" ...</pre>
      depending on the platform. Omit the quotes if your classpath
      doesn't have spaces in it.
          
    <h3>Find the deployment descriptor </h3>

    <p>
    
    Look in axis/samples/stock for the file deploy.wsdd. This is the
    deployment descriptor we want to tell Axis about. Deployment
    descriptors are an Axis-specific XML file, that tells Axis how to
    deploy (or undeploy) a Web Service, and how to configure Axis
    itself. The Axis Administration Web Service lets the AdminClient
    program and its Ant sibling submit a new WSDD file for
    interpretation. The Axis 'engine' will update its configuration,
    then save its state. 
    
    <p>
    
    By default Axis saves it state into the global configuration file, 
    axis/WEB-INF/server-config.wsdd. Sometimes you see a warning message
    about such a file not being found -don't worry about this, because 
    Axis auto-creates the file after you deploy something to it.
    You can check in the webapp to see what this file looks like -and
    even copy it to other systems if you want to give them identical
    configurations. Note that Axis needs an expanded webapplication
    <i>and</i> write access to the WEB-INF dir to save its state to this
    location. 
    
    <h3>Run the admin client</h3>      
          
    Execute the following command from the samples/stock directory:
          <blockquote>
              <code class="java">java -cp %AXISCLASSPATH% org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient <br>
                -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/services/AdminService deploy.wsdd</code>
          </blockquote>

    If you get some java client error (like ClassNotFoundException),
    then you haven't set up your classpath right, mistyped the
    classname, or done some other standard error. Tracking down such
    problems is foundation Java development skills -if you don't know
    how to do it, learn them now. 
    
    <p><span class="note">Note:</span>
    You may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with the
    port number used by your web server.If you have renamed the web application,
    something other than "axis" change the URL appropriately.</p>


    <p>
    If you get some AxisFault listing, then the client is working, but
    the deployment was unsuccessful. This is where the knowledge of the
    sockets API to TCP and the basics of the HTTP that Web Service 
    development requires begins to be needed. If you got some socket
    error like connection refused, well, clearly the thing at the far
    end isnt talking to you, so find the cause of that fix it. If you
    get any Http error code back, well, you know what the error codes
    mean, right? If you are going to develop Web Services -you need to.

    The <a href="user-guide.html">user's guide</a> covers the
    AdminClient in more detail, and there is also an 
    <a href="ant/axis-admin.html">Ant task</a> to automate its use in your
    build process.

    <h2>Step 7: testing</h2>

    <p>This step is optional, but highly recommended. For illustrative
    purposes, it is presumed that you have installed and deployed the stockquote
    demo.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Change directory to the distribution directory for xml-axis
          and execute the following command (or its Unix equivalent):
          <blockquote>
              <code  class="java">java -cp "%AXISCLASSPATH%" samples.stock.GetQuote <br>
               -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/servlet/AxisServlet -uuser1 -wpass1 XXX</code>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      <li>You should get back "55.25" as a result.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span>
    Again, you may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with
    the port number used by your web server. If you have renamed the web application,
    something other than "axis" change the URL appropriately.

    <h2>Advanced Installation: adding Axis to your own Webapp</h2>
    
    If you are experienced in webapp development, and especially if you
    want to add web services to an existing or complex webapp, you can
    take an alternate approach to running Axis. Instead of adding your
    classes to the axis webapp, you can add Axis to your application. 
    <p>
    The core concepts are
    <ol>
    <li>Add axis.jar, wsdl.jar, saaj.jar, jaxrpc.jar and the other
    dependent libraries to your WAR file.
    <li>Copy all the Axis Servlet declarations and mappings from 
    axis/WEB-INF/web.xml and add them to your own web.xml
    <li>Build and deploy your webapp. 
    <li>Run the Axis AdminClient against your own webapp, instead of
    Axis, by changing the URL you invoke it with.
    </ol>

    The process is also covered in chapter 15 of 
    <A href="http://manning.com/antbook">Java Development with Ant</A>,
    which can be downloaded as a 
    <A href="http://www.manning.com/hatcher/chap15.pdf">PDF file</A>.

    <h2>What if it doesn't work?</h2>
    
    Axis is a complicated system to install. This is because it depends
    on the underlying functionality of your app server, has a fairly
    complex configuration, and, like all distributed applications, 
    depends upon the network too. 
    
    <p>
    
    We see a lot of people posting their problems on the axis-user
    mailing lists, and other axis users, and the developers do their
    best to help when they can. But before you rush to post your own
    problems to the mail list, a word of caution.
    
    <p>
    
    Axis is free. This means nobody gets paid to man the support lines.
    All the help you get from the community is voluntary and
    comes from the kindness of their hearts. They may be other users,
    willing to help you get past the same hurdles they had to be helped
    over, they may be the developers themselves. But it is all
    voluntary, so keep your expectations low.
    
    <ol>

    
    <li>Post to the user mail list, not the developer list. You may
    think the developer mail list is a short cut to higher quality
    answers. Yet there are less people on that list, and we often ignore
    questions that should go to the user group. We read that mailing
    list too, see. 
    
    </li>

    <li> 
    Don't ask off-axis questions. The list is not the place to
    ask about non-axis, non-soap, problems. Even questions about the MS
    Soap toolkit or .NET client side, dont get many positive answers -we
    avoid them. That also goes for the Sun Java Web Services Developer
    Pack, or the Jboss.net stuff that they've done with Axis. 
    </li>
    
    <li>Never bother posting to the soapbuilders mailing list
    either, that is only for people developing SOAP toolkits, not using
    them -all off-topic messages are pointedly ignored.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    There is no guarantee that anyone will be able to solve your
    problem. The usual response in such a situation is silence, for 
    a good reason: if everybody who didn't know the answer to a question
    said "I don't know", the list would be overflowed with noise. Dont
    take a silence personally.
    
    <li>
    Never expect an immediate answer. Even if someone knows the answer,
    it can take a day or two before they read their mail. So if you don't
    get an answer in an hour or two, don't panic and resend. Be patient.
    And put the time to use by trying to solve your problems yourself.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Do your homework first. This document lists the foundational stuff
    you need to understand. Its also warned you that it can take a day
    to get a reply. Now imagine you get a Http Error '404' on a SOAP
    call. Should you rush to post a 'help' request, or should you try
    and find out what an HTTP error code is, what #404 usually means and
    how to use a Java debugger. We provide the source to make that
    debugging easier :)
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Post meaningful subject lines. You want your message read, not
    deleted unread. 'Help' is not meaningful. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Use the <a
    href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=49">
    mailing list archive</a> to see if someone had the same problem.
    This list is searchable. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Use the <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/">bugzilla</a>
    database to search for Axis bugs, both open and closed.
    </li>

    <li> Consult the
      <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages">
      Axis Wiki</a>
      For its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), installation notes,
      interoperability issues lists, and other useful information.
    </li>

    <li>
    
    Don't email people for help directly, unless you know them. It's rude and
    presumptious. Messages sent over the mail list benefit the whole
    community -the readers and people who search the list. Personal
    messages just take up the recipients time, and are unwelcome.
    Usually, the recipients of personal requests just say 'ask the mail
    list'. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Know that configuration problems are hard to replicate, so hard to 
    get help on. We try with things like happyaxis.jsp to automate the
    diagnostics, but its hard for people to help here, especially for
    the obscure platforms. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Keep up to date with Axis releases, even the beta copies of
    forthcoming releases. You dont want your problem to be a bug that is
    already known and fixed? Often the common response to any question
    is 'have you tried the latest release'.
    
    <li>
    Use the source, fix it when you find defects. Even fix the
    documentation when you find defects. It is only through the
    participation of Axis's users that it will ever get better. 
    
    </ol>
    
    Has this put you off joining and participating in the Axis user
    mail list? We hope not -this list belongs to the people who use Axis
    and so will be your peers as your project proceeds. We just need for
    you to be aware that it is not a 7x24 support line for people new to
    server side Java development, and that you need to be somewhat self
    sufficient. It is not a silver bullet. Knowing how to make effective
    use of the list, will help you develop better with Axis. 
    
    
    <a name="summary"/></a>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    
    Axis is simply an implementation of SOAP which can be added to your
    own webapp, and a webapp which can host your own web services.
    Installing it can be a bit fiddly, especially given Java1.4's
    stricter requirements. If you follow a methodical process, and test
    along the way, using happyaxis and the bundled test services, you
    will find it easier to get started with Axis.
