<title>UI Components for AST</title>
</head>

<!-- Javadoc only copies body contents -->
<body>
    This package is intended as a repository for components that are
    useful when developing UIs that control the {@link uk.ac.starlink.ast} 
    class library. 
    <p>
    The main contents are currently a generic interface for
    configuring AST Plots {@link PlotConfigurator} and a number of
    models of the contents of various related plot options. These
    are unified by the {@link PlotConfiguration} class.
    Configurations can be applied to Plots and stored/restored from
    XML (see {@link uk.ac.starlink.util.XMLEncodeDecode}).
    <p>
    In addition to the standard Plot configuration options, extra
    pages of controls can be added to the {@link PlotConfigurator}, 
    these can then be used to configure related features. The classes 
    {@link GraphicsHints}, {@link GraphicsEdges} and {@link ColourStore}, 
    together with their related controls exemplify this (also see the 
    TestPlotConfigFrame.java example file in the source release).
    <p>
    The presentation of AST axis related values can be made to work in
    a native fashion using the {@link AstDouble} class, and the
    various components that make use of it: 
    {@link AstDoubleField}, {@link AstCellEditor} and 
    {@link AstDoubleDocument}. For completeness there's also a similar
    {@link DecimalField} for simple numbers.
    <p>
    Finally a set of classes for displaying all the fonts in a Font
    and choosing any characters for export are available (see 
    {@link uk.ac.starlink.util.gui.SelectCharacters} and supporting classes).
