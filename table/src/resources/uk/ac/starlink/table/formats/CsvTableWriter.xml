<p>Writes tables in the semi-standard Comma-Separated Values format.
This does not preserve any metadata apart from column names,
and is generally inefficient to read,
but it can be useful for importing into certain external applications,
such as some databases or spreadsheets.
</p>

<p>By default, the first line is a header line giving the column names,
but this can be inhibited using the <code>header=false</code>
configuration option.
</p>

<p>The <code>delimiter</code> option makes it possible to use non-comma
characters to separate fields.  Depending on the character used this
may behave in surprising ways; in particular for space-separated fields
the <ref id="outAscii"><code>ascii</code></ref> format may be a better choice.
