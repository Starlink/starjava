Provides the structuring for the HDX system.

<p>This is the package which defines the structure of the HDX system,
registers new types, and is responsible for managing the 
implementations of the various factories required.</p>

<p>HDX is defined as a DOM.  This does not mean that an HDX object
necessarily <em>is</em> a DOM -- it could be represented as a Source,
as a SAX stream, or ultimately not in an XML form at all -- however,
it is defined using DOM terminology, and all operations on it are
representable in those terms.</p>

<p>An HDX is a DOM {@link org.w3c.dom.Document} node,
which has a document element of type <code>&lt;hdx&gt;</code>, which
in turn contains other elements of <a href="#hdxtypes" >registered
types</a>.  HDX does not define or constrain these other types
(instead providing facilities for <a href="#newtypes" >defining
them</a>), other than to require that they be defined in DOM terms.
<!--
The structure and semantics of these other types are defined using DOM
terminology, and they are always representable as a DOM, and are
navigable, manipulable, and in some cases modifiable, using that
DOM.-->
</p>

<p>The types are not generally processable using the DOM, however, and
so they must be transformed into a Java object before work can be done
on them.  This transformation may involve significant (one-time) work,
if the object has to be assembled from information in the DOM, or it
may be trivial, if the DOM in fact mirrors some underlying object.
During processing, the object will generally be manipulated using some
interface defined as part of the resulting Java object's
specification.</p>

<h2 id="hdxtypes">HDX types</h2>

<p>All important elements in the HDX DOM correspond to types
registered with the HDX system.  Only those elements which correspond
to registered types can be constructed as Java objects.  However, not
all elements must be registered -- elements which are embedded within
important types, and which do not have to be children of the
<code>&lt;hdx&gt;</code> element, do not have to be registered or have
handlers.</p>

<p>Types are registered by creating an instance of class
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType}, using the static method
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType#newHdxResourceType newHdxResourceType}.
See <a href="#newtypes" >below</a> for an example.</p>

<h2>Important classes and interfaces</h2>

<p>The two core classes in the Hdx package are:</p>
<dl>

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType}</dt>
<dd>Instances of this define the types known to Hdx.  These instances
encapsulate type information, including the methods which check
type-validity of Hdx objects.</dd>

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory}</dt>
<dd>This is the gateway to the Hdx system.  This class marshalls the various
factories responsible for creating objects and the DOM representations 
of them, and is responsible for normalising and validating files which
purport to be Hdx instances.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The most important interfaces are:

<dl>
<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxContainer}</dt>
<dd>This is the type which represents an Hdx object
as a whole.  The first stage of processing a data object is to turn it
from its original form -- a FITS or XML file, perhaps, or an object on
the network -- into a <code>HdxContainer</code>.  <code>HdxFactory</code> is
what achieves this, possibly with the background help of an
<code>HdxDocumentFactory</code>.</dd>

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFacade}</dt>
<dd>This is how a Java class represents itself to the DOM world.  See
below.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The most important interfaces <em>for implementors</em> are:

<dl>
<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxDocumentFactory}</dt>

<dd>Implementations of <code>HdxDocumentFactory</code> are what
constructs <code>HdxContainer</code>s from URIs and URLs.  A class
which is able to construct 
a DOM from a particular class of URL -- such as a URL pointing to a
FITS file, for example -- registers a <code>HdxDocumentFactory</code>
instance with <code>HdxFactory</code>'s {@link
uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory#registerHdxDocumentFactory
registerHdxDocumentFactory}: when <code>HdxFactory</code> is asked to
construct a DOM by a call to its {@link
uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory#newHdxContainer newHdxContainer} methods,
it works through the list of registered factories until one of them
successfully constructs the DOM.  The methods of this interface are
not called directly by client code, but are implemented by those
adding new file formats (such as FITS or HDS, say) to the Hdx system.</dd>

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceFactory}</dt>
<dd>Implementations of the
<code>HdxResourceFactory</code> type are responsible for exposing a DOM 
element as a Java object.  The methods of this interface are not
called directly by client code, but are implemented by those adding
new types (such as Weather, say) to the Hdx system.</dd>

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFacade}</dt>
<dd>This is the interface through which a Java object makes itself
visible in DOM/Source terms.  Interfaces such as {@link
uk.ac.starlink.ndx.Ndx} or {@link uk.ac.starlink.array.NDArray} have a
<code>getHdxFacade</code> method.  This can be incorporated into a DOM
based on {@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxDocument} by using that class's extension method
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxDocument#createElement(HdxFacade)}: the
resulting element behaves exactly like a <code>org.w3c.dom</code>
element, except that all its DOM-building (and optionally
DOM-mutating) methods are handled by the <code>HdxFacade</code>, which
knows exactly the state of the underlying object, and which can <em>return</em>
the underlying object particularly easily.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The <code>HdxContainer</code>interface is used by most code which
wants to use Hdx objects.  The two factory interfaces are <em>not</em>
used by client code, but exist in order to be implemented by those
extending the system.</p>

<h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2>

<p>Hdx objects may be synthesized from binary data files such as HDS
or FITS files, or else they may be extracted from the DOMs constructed from
XML files.  If the thing (Element or URI) passed to method 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory#newHdxContainer newHdxContainer}
corresponds to a registered Hdx type and it is in no namespace, then
the input DOM is processed as you might expect.</p>

<p>The factory can also process elements in a more sophisticated way.
If the element passed to <code>newHdxContainer</code> does not
correspond to a registered type, or it is in the Hdx namespace, then
the method will examine <em>only</em> those elements and attributes in
the Hdx namespace
(see W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/" >namespaces
spec</a>).  This means that the Hdx information is able to be carried
inside another unrelated XML file, invisible to a namespace-aware
processor examinging only the `background' XML.</p>

<p>The Hdx namespace is defined to be
<code>http://www.starlink.ac.uk/HDX</code>, which string is accessible 
as
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType#HDX_NAMESPACE}.  The Hdx DOM
which is constructed from such an input element contains only the
Hdx-registered elements, in no namespace, so that users of the DOM do
not have to worry about the occasionally subtle details of namespace
processing.  Thus the XML file</p>

<pre>
    &lt;rubbish xmlns:x="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/HDX"&gt;
      &lt;x:hdx&gt;
        &lt;x:ndx&gt;
          &lt;x:data uri="file:/tmp/mydata.sdf"/&gt;
        &lt;/x:ndx&gt;
      &lt;/x:hdx&gt;
    &lt;/rubbish&gt;
</pre>

<p>is transformed into the simpler DOM</p>

<pre>
    &lt;hdx&gt;
      &lt;ndx&gt;
        &lt;data uri="file:/tmp/mydata.sdf"/&gt;
      &lt;/ndx&gt;
    &lt;/hdx&gt;
</pre>

<p>Changes made to the attributes in this transformed DOM are
reflected in the original DOM.</p>

<p>Further transformations happen when a DOM is imported into
Hdx.  Firstly, the attribute `<code>name</code>' in the Hdx namespace 
is transformed into an element with that name.  Secondly, if an
Hdx type has a `hoist' attribute defined (see
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType#setHoistAttribute setHoistAttribute}),
then any text content of the element will be hoisted up to form the
content of that hoist attribute.  Finally, if the Hdx DOM which
results from this does not have <code>&lt;hdx&gt;</code> as its top
element, but instead an element which is a valid child of
<code>&lt;hdx&gt;</code>, then it is inserted into a
<code>&lt;hdx&gt;</code> element.  Thus</p>

<pre>
    &lt;mystructure&gt;
      &lt;mypointer x:name="ndx" xmlns:x="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/HDX"&gt;
        mydata.sdf
      &lt;/mypointer&gt;
    &lt;/mystructure&gt;
</pre>

<p>is transformed into</p>

<pre>
    &lt;hdx&gt;
      &lt;ndx uri="mydata.sdf"/&gt;
    &lt;/hdx&gt;
</pre>

<p>and processed accordingly.</p>

<p>If you are <em>particularly</em> familiar with the W3C Namespaces
spec, then you will have objected that the `<code>uri</code>'
attribute in the first example was formally in <em>no</em> namespace,
and should not therefore have been processed.  This is true, but it is
so unhelpfully counter-intuitive that as a special case, the
normalisation process described here processes such no-namespace
attributes in the Hdx namespace <em>if</em> the element is itself in
the Hdx namespace, as is the case in the example above.</p>

<h2>Usage: reading XML and other files</h2>

<p>Use
<code>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory}.{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory#getInstance getInstance()}.{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory#newHdxContainer(java.net.URI)
newHdxContainer(URI)}</code> to extract HDX objects from URIs, and
method
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory#newHdxContainer(org.w3c.dom.Element) newHdxContainer(Element)}
to extract Hdx objects from DOMs, using the namespace mechanism
described <a href="#namespaces">above</a>.</p>

<h2 id="newtypes">Usage: defining new types</h2>

<p>To define a new type, you must create a new
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType}, using method
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType#newHdxResourceType}, and then act
on the resulting object to register validators and constructors.  For
example, the (very simple) definition of the
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType#TITLE} object consists of:</p>

<pre>
     TITLE = HdxResourceType.newHdxResourceType("title");
     TITLE.setHoistAttribute("value");
     TITLE.setElementValidator(new ElementValidator() {
         public boolean validateElement(Element el) {
             // A TITLE element is valid if it has an attribute "value"
             return HdxResourceType.match(el) == TITLE
                 &amp;&amp; el.hasAttribute(TITLE.getHoistAttribute());
         }
     });
</pre>
<p>The hoist attribute means that, as described in the <a
href="#namespaces">namespaces</a> section above, the element
<code>&lt;title&gt;My title&lt;/title&gt;</code> is equivalent to the
normalised form <code>&lt;title value="My title"/&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The {@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType#HDX} type has a somewhat more
complicated validator, plus the assertion</p>

<pre>
     HDX.setConstructedClass("uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxContainer");
</pre>

<p>that constructed (Java) objects must be instances of the
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxContainer} interface.</p>

<p>This creation and registration code is located in the static
initialiser of a suitable class.  This registration is therefore
performed whenever this class is loaded and initialised.  That happens
whenever an object of that class is created, or a static method
invoked.  The class may also be loaded explicitly by declaring some
properties, as described in {@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType}.</p>

<p>New types may be declared in their own package, or in the package
<code>uk.ac.starlink.hdx.extension</code>; non-Starlink types should
<em>not</em> be declared in the <code>uk.ac.starlink.hdx</code>
package, nor in any other package with prefix <code>uk.ac.starlink</code>.</p>

<p>For an example of a simple class, see the sample class
<code>SimpleWeather.java</code>, included in the distribution.</p>

<h2>Usage: adding new file formats</h2>

<p>To add a new file format which can be given a DOM interface, you
must create a class which implements {@link
uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxDocumentFactory}, which turns a URL into a DOM
Document.</p>

<p>Such extending classes are registered with the Hdx system using
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory#registerHdxDocumentFactory}, by a mechanism which is
described in the {@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFactory} class documentation.</p>

<p>These factories can be arbitrarily clever.  They can either create
a simple DOM and wait for the work of reading the file to be done by
the constructors registered with the type using
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxResourceType#registerHdxResourceFactory}, or else the factory can construct the
object, using a class which implements the {@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxFacade}
interface, and then create an Element which uses that facade using
{@link uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxDocument#createElement(HdxFacade)}.  For
further details about this route, including an example, see the {@link
uk.ac.starlink.hdx.HdxDocumentFactory} documentation.</p>

<p>That covers construction of a complete Hdx DOM from a URI.
However, you should also handle, if appropriate, a reference to your
new file format from within a DOM.  In the case of the Ndx type, that
can be done with a construction such as</p>

<pre>
     ndxType.registerHdxResourceFactory(new HdxResourceFactory() {
         public Object getObject(Element el)
                 throws HdxException {
             return new BridgeNdx(new DomNdxImpl(el));
         }
     });
</pre>

<p>where <code>ndxType</code> is the <code>HdxResourceType</code>
object which this initialiser has obtained either from
<code>HdxResourceType.match("ndx")</code> or, preferably, from its
initialisation of the Ndx type using <code>newHdxResourceType</code>.
The class <code>DomNdxImpl</code> is a class which is private to the
Ndx package.</p>
