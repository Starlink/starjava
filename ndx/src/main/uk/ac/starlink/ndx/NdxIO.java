/**
 * Performs I/O between Ndx objects and resources named by URLs.
 * Methods are available to construct a readable Ndx from a URL
 * pointing to an existing resource, or to construct a new Ndx located 
 * at a given URL and populate it from the content of an existing Ndx.
 * <p>
 * This factory delegates the actual Ndx I/O to external
 * NdxHandler objects; the URL is passed to each one in turn until
 * one recognises the URL as one it can deal with, at which point the
 * rest of the work is handed off to that object.
 * <p>
 * By default, if the corresponding classes are present, the following
 * NdxHandlers are installed:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link uk.ac.starlink.hds.NDFNdxHandler}
 * <li>{@link uk.ac.starlink.oldfits.FitsNdxHandler}
 * <li>{@link uk.ac.starlink.ndx.XMLNdxHandler}
 * </ul>
 * Consult the documentation of these classes to find out about the format 
 * of URLs understood by each.
