Classes for manipulating N-dimensional astronomical data objects.

<h3>World coordinate systems</h3>

The JNIAST package, i.e. classes in <code>uk.ac.starlink.ast</code>
is currently used for treatment of world coordianate systems (WCS) 
within this package.
JNIAST is based on native compiled code, which may not be available
on all platforms/installations.  In the absence of the JNIAST 
package shared libraries (on unix, this typically means that 
<code>libjniast.so</code> is not on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH), the NDX
classes will still function without crashing, but will in general 
ignore WCS information where it exists.  Cases which explicitly require
WCS information however will generally cause a fatal error 
(some sort of {@link java.lang.LinkageError}).

<p>For example, if JNIAST is not installed the 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.ndx.Ndx#hasWCS} method 
will always return <code>false</code>, but the 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.ndx.Ndxs#getAst} method
will throw an error.
