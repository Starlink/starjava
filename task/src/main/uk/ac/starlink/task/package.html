A framework for invoking user-level tasks.

<p>This package provides the necessary infrastructure for writing
tasks that do things for users, along the same lines as ADAM A-tasks.
An example of use is given in the separate NDTools package.

<p>At the moment all the necessary machinery is provided for invoking
tasks from the command line in a way that looks ADAM-like,
but it is designed so that, for instance, a GUI-style invoker 
could be written to invoke the same tasks.

<p>The provided components are as follows:
<dl>

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.task.Parameter}
<dd>is an object which knows about the name, default value, data type, 
    validity constraints etc of a parameter of a task.  It also stores
    the actual value of the parameter when it has been obtained from
    the environment.  When it has obtained a value it can return it
    as a string.
    <code>Parameter</code> can be subclassed to enforce different validity
    constraints or so it knows how to return itself as some object other
    than a string (see for instance 
    {@link uk.ac.starlink.task.IntegerParameter}).

<dt><code>{@link uk.ac.starlink.task.Environment}</code>
<dd>is an interface which defines how to request
    the value of a parameter.  It can also tell you about what output
    stream to use for messages to be dispatched to the user.

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.task.TerminalEnvironment}
<dd>is an implementation of <code>Environment</code> which assumes a user
    is sitting at a terminal with standard input and standard output.

<dt>{@link uk.ac.starlink.task.TerminalInvoker}
<dd>given a map of task names to <code>Task</code> objects will use a 
    <code>TerminalEnvironment</code> to invoke tasks from
    an <code>args</code>-style string array.

<dt><code>{@link uk.ac.starlink.task.Task}</code>
<dd>is the interface which user tasks themselves have to implement.
    A Task must be able to return a list of the parameters which it uses;
    since each parameter knows its name, default value, order on the
    command line, prompt string etc, this tells the Environment 
    everything it needs to know about how to get the value, including
    what to prompt the user etc.
    It must also be able to invoke itself on request.
    During invocation, it can interrogate its parameters to find out
    what their values are.

</dl>

<p>Setting up a user-level package containing tasks is then a case of
writing a top-level class with a <code>main</code> method which invokes
<code>TerminalInvoker</code>, and writing a number of classes which 
implement <code>Task</code>.  See the NDTools package for an example.

<p>To invoke the same tasks from a GUI you'd want to write something like
a <code>GUIEnvironment</code> and <code>GUIInvoker</code> class.
