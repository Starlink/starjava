/**
 * Represents a stream-like source of data.
 * Instances of this class can be used to encapsulate the data available
 * from a stream.  The idea is that the stream should return the same
 * sequence of bytes each time.
 * <p>
 * As well as the ability to return a stream, a <code>DataSource</code> may
 * also have a <code>position</code>, which corresponds to the 'ref' or 'frag'
 * part of a URL (the bit after the #).  This is an indication
 * of a location in the stream; it is a string, and its interpretation
 * is entirely up to the application (though may be specified by
 * the documentation of specific <code>DataSource</code> subclasses).
 * <p>
 * As well as providing the facility for several different objects to
 * get their own copy of the underlying input stream, this class also
 * handles decompression of the stream.
 * Compression types are as understood by the associated {@link Compression}
 * class.
 * <p>
 * For efficiency, a buffer of the bytes at the start of the stream
 * called the 'intro buffer'
 * is recorded the first time that the stream is read.  This can then
 * be used for magic number queries cheaply, without having to open
 * a new input stream.  In the case that the whole input stream 
 * is shorter than the intro buffer, the underlying input stream 
 * never has to be read again.
 * <p>
 * Any implementation which implements {@link #getRawInputStream} in such
 * a way as to return different byte sequences on different occasions
 * may lead to unpredictable behaviour from this class.
