STILTS Licensing Arrangements
-----------------------------

The STILTS application is licensed under the GNU General Public License
(GPL) available from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.

Most, though not all, of the library code that it uses is however
available under more permissive licenses.  The code original to
STILTS, and all of the other starjava (uk.ac.starlink.*) classes,
are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL),
available from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html.
The third party dependencies have a mixed bag of licenses.
(For the original code, if even the LGPL is not acceptable to you,
I might be able to offer other licenses.)

Not all of these libraries are required for all the functions of STILTS.
So, depending on what you want to do, you may be able to just throw
out those libraries whose licenses you find unacceptable and
use the remainder.  If you don't see runtime NoClassDefFoundErrors,
it's worked!  For a less haphazard approach to determining whether
certain libraries are required for certain operations, feel free
to contact me.

There follows a list of the individual libraries and their licenses.
These refer to the jar files built used or built by the starjava build
system, and are available as named if you download STILTS in the form of
an archive of individual jar files (stilts_jars.zip) rather than
the monolithic standalone jar file (stilts.jar).  I'll try to keep
this list up to date, but if there are missing entries please complain.
