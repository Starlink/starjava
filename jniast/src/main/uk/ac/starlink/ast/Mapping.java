/**
 * Java interface to the AST Mapping class
 *  - inter-relate two coordinate systems. 
 * This class provides the basic facilities for transforming a set
 * of coordinates (representing "input" points) to give a new set
 * of coordinates (representing "output" points).  It is used to
 * describe the relationship which exists between two different
 * coordinate systems and to implement operations which make use of
 * this (such as transforming coordinates and resampling grids of
 * data).  However, the Mapping class does not have a constructor
 * function of its own, as it is simply a container class for a
 * family of specialised Mappings which implement particular types
 * of coordinate transformation.

     * Resample a region of a data grid.   
     * This is a set of functions for resampling gridded data (e.g. an
     * image) under the control of a geometrical transformation, which
     * is specified by a Mapping.  The functions operate on a pair of
     * data grids (input and output), each of which may have any number
     * of dimensions. Resampling may be restricted to a specified
     * region of the output grid. An associated grid of error estimates
     * associated with the input data may also be supplied (in the form
     * of variance values), so as to produce error estimates for the
     * resampled output data. Propagation of missing data (bad pixels)
     * is supported.
     * <p>
     * You should use a resampling function which matches the numerical
     * type of the data you are processing by replacing <X> in
     * the generic function name astResample<X> by an appropriate 1- or
     * 2-character type code. For example, if you are resampling data
     * with type "float", you should use the function astResampleF (see
     * the "Data Type Codes" section below for the codes appropriate to
     * other numerical types).
     * <p>
     * Resampling of the grid of input data is performed by
     * transforming the coordinates of the centre of each output grid
     * element (or pixel) into the coordinate system of the input grid.
     * Since the resulting coordinates will not, in general, coincide
     * with the centre of an input pixel, sub-pixel interpolation is
     * performed between the neighbouring input pixels. This produces a
     * resampled value which is then assigned to the output pixel. A
     * choice of sub-pixel interpolation schemes is provided, but you
     * may also implement your own.
     * <p>
     * This algorithm samples the input data value, it does not integrate 
     * it. Thus total data value in the input image will not, in general,
     * be conserved. However, an option is provided (see the "Control Flags"
     * section below) which can produce approximate flux conservation by 
     * scaling the output values using the ratio of the output pixel size
     * to the input pixel size. However, if accurate flux conservation is
     * important to you, consder using the
     * astRebin<X> or astRebinSeq<X> family of functions
     * instead.
     * <p>
     * Output pixel coordinates are transformed into the coordinate
     * system of the input grid using the inverse transformation of the
     * Mapping which is supplied. This means that geometrical features
     * in the input data are subjected to the Mapping's forward
     * transformation as they are transferred from the input to the
     * output grid (although the Mapping's forward transformation is
     * not explicitly used).
     * <p>
     * In practice, transforming the coordinates of every pixel of a
     * large data grid can be time-consuming, especially if the Mapping
     * involves complicated functions, such as sky projections. To
     * improve performance, it is therefore possible to approximate
     * non-linear Mappings by a set of linear transformations which are
     * applied piece-wise to separate sub-regions of the data. This
     * approximation process is applied automatically by an adaptive
     * algorithm, under control of an accuracy criterion which
     * expresses the maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may
     * be introduced, as a fraction of a pixel.
     * <p>
     * This algorithm first attempts to approximate the Mapping with a
     * linear transformation applied over the whole region of the
     * output grid which is being used. If this proves to be
     * insufficiently accurate, the output region is sub-divided into
     * two along its largest dimension and the process is repeated
     * within each of the resulting sub-regions. This process of
     * sub-division continues until a sufficiently good linear
     * approximation is found, or the region to which it is being
     * applied becomes too small (in which case the original Mapping is
     * used directly).
     * <h4>Notes</h4>
     * <br> - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
     * with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
     * reason.
     * <h4>Propagation of Missing Data</h4>
     * Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is specified, instances of missing data 
     * (bad pixels) in the output grid are
     * identified by occurrences of the "badval" value in the "out"
     * array. These may be produced if any of the following happen:
     * <p>
     * <br> - The input position (the transformed position of the output
     * pixel's centre) lies outside the boundary of the grid of input
     * pixels.
     * <br> - The input position lies inside the boundary of a bad input
     * pixel. In this context, an input pixel is considered bad if its
     * data value is equal to "badval" and the AST__USEBAD flag is
     * set via the "flags" parameter.
     * (Positions which have half-integral coordinate values, and
     * therefore lie on a pixel boundary, are regarded as lying within
     * the pixel with the larger, i.e. more positive, index.)
     * <br> - The set of neighbouring input pixels (excluding those which
     * are bad) is unsuitable for calculating an interpolated
     * value. Whether this is true may depend on the sub-pixel
     * interpolation scheme in use.
     * <br> - The interpolated value lies outside the range which can be
     * represented using the data type of the "out" array.
     * <p>
     * In addition, associated output variance estimates (if
     * calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the "badval"
     * value in the "out_var" array under any of the following
     * circumstances:
     * <p>
     * <br> - The associated resampled data value (in the "out" array) is bad.
     * <br> - The set of neighbouring input pixels which contributed to the
     * output data value do not all have valid variance estimates
     * associated with them. In this context, an input variance
     * estimate may be regarded as bad either because it has the value
     * "badval" (and the AST__USEBAD flag is set), or because it is
     * negative.
     * <br> - The set of neighbouring input pixels for which valid variance
     * values are available is unsuitable for calculating an overall
     * variance value. Whether this is true may depend on the sub-pixel
     * interpolation scheme in use.
     * <br> - The variance value lies outside the range which can be
     * represented using the data type of the "out_var" array.
     * <p>
     * If the AST__NOBAD flag is specified via
     * parameter "flags",
     * then output array elements that would otherwise be set to 
     * "badval"
     * are instead left holding the value they had on entry to this
     * function. The number of such array elements is returned as
     * the function value.
     * @param   ndim_in
     * The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
     * least one.

     * 
     * @param   ubnd_in
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
     * the input grid along each dimension.
     * <p>
     * Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
     * and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
     * (j'th) dimension being ubnd_in[j]-lbnd_in[j]+1 (assuming the
     * index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
     * the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
     * extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
     * at its centre.
     * 
     * @param   in
     * Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
     * input grid, containing the input data to be resampled.  The
     * numerical type of this array should match the 1- or
     * 2-character type code appended to the function name (e.g. if
     * you are using astResampleF, the type of each array element
     * should be "float").
     * <p>
     * The storage order of data within this array should be such

     * 
     * @param   in_var
     * An optional pointer to a second array with the same size and

     * array. If this array is supplied (together with the

     * <p>
     * If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
     * of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is

     * time.
     * 
     * @param   maxpix
     * A value which specifies an initial scale size (in pixels) for
     * the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
     * with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
     * be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
     * the output grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
     * approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
     * made over the entire output region.
     * <p>
     * If a smaller value is used, the output region will first be
     * divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
     * pixels in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts at
     * approximation commence.
     * <p>
     * This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
     * convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
     * Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
     * irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
     * say, 50 to 100 pixels can also be employed as a safeguard in
     * general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
     * minimal.
     * <p>
     * If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
     * inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
     * setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
     * performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
     * 
     * @param   badval
     * This argument should have the same type as the elements of
     * the "in" array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
     * data (bad pixels) in the input and output arrays.
     * <p>
     * If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the "flags" parameter,
     * then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the "in"
     * (and "in_var") array(s).
     * <p>
     * Unless the AST__NOBAD flag is set via the "flags" parameter,
     * this value is also used to flag any output
     * elements in the "out" (and "out_var") array(s) for which
     * resampled values could not be obtained (see the "Propagation
     * of Missing Data" section below for details of the
     * circumstances under which this may occur). The astResample<X>
     * function return value indicates whether any such values have
     * been produced. If the AST__NOBAD flag is set. then output array
     * elements for which no resampled value could be obtained are
     * left set to the value they had on entry to this function.
     * 
     * @param   ndim_out
     * The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
     * at least one. It need not necessarily be equal to the number
     * of dimensions in the input grid.
     * 
     * @param   lbnd_out
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
     * in the output grid along each dimension.
     * 
     * @param   ubnd_out
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
     * the output grid along each dimension.
     * <p>
     * Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the
     * shape, size and coordinate system of the output grid in the
     * same way as "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" define the shape, size
     * and coordinate system of the input grid.
     * 
     * @param   lbnd
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the first pixel in the region
     * of the output grid for which a resampled value is to be
     * calculated.
     * 
     * @param   ubnd
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the last pixel in the region of
     * the output grid for which a resampled value is to be
     * calculated.
     * <p>
     * Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" together define the shape and
     * position of a (hyper-)rectangular region of the output grid
     * for which resampled values should be produced. This region
     * should lie wholly within the extent of the output grid (as
     * defined by the "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" arrays). Regions of
     * the output grid lying outside this region will not be
     * modified.
     * 
     * @param   out
     * Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
     * output grid, into which the resampled data values will be
     * returned. The numerical type of this array should match that
     * of the "in" array, and the data storage order should be such
     * that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
     * rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
     * (i.e. Fortran array indexing is used).
     * 
     * @param   out_var
     * An optional pointer to an array with the same type and size
     * as the "out" array. If given, this array will be used to
     * return variance estimates for the resampled data values. This
     * array will only be used if the "in_var" array has also been
     * supplied.
     * <p>
     * The output variance values will be calculated on the
     * assumption that errors on the input data values are
     * statistically independent and that their variance estimates
     * may simply be summed (with appropriate weighting factors)
     * when several input pixels contribute to an output data
     * value. If this assumption is not valid, then the output error
     * estimates may be biased. In addition, note that the
     * statistical errors on neighbouring output data values (as
     * well as the estimates of those errors) may often be
     * correlated, even if the above assumption about the input data
     * is correct, because of the sub-pixel interpolation schemes
     * employed.
     * <p>
     * If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
     * should be given.
     * 
     * @return  The number of output pixels for which no valid resampled value
     * could be obtained. Thus, in the absence of any error, a returned 
     * value of zero indicates that all the required output pixels 
     * received valid resampled data values (and variances). See the
     * "badval" and "flags" parameters.
     * 
     * @throws  AstException  if an error occurred in the AST library

    /** 
     * Rebin a region of a data grid.   
     * This is a set of functions for rebinning gridded data (e.g. an
     * image) under the control of a geometrical transformation, which
     * is specified by a Mapping.  The functions operate on a pair of
     * data grids (input and output), each of which may have any number
     * of dimensions. Rebinning may be restricted to a specified
     * region of the input grid. An associated grid of error estimates
     * associated with the input data may also be supplied (in the form
     * of variance values), so as to produce error estimates for the
     * rebined output data. Propagation of missing data (bad pixels)
     * is supported.
     * <p>
     * Note, if you will be rebining a sequence of input arrays and then 
     * co-adding them into a single array, the alternative 
     * astRebinSeq<X> functions
     * will in general be more efficient.
     * <p>
     * You should use a rebinning function which matches the numerical
     * type of the data you are processing by replacing <X> in
     * the generic function name astRebin<X> by an appropriate 1- or
     * 2-character type code. For example, if you are rebinning data
     * with type "float", you should use the function astRebinF (see
     * the "Data Type Codes" section below for the codes appropriate to
     * other numerical types).
     * <p>
     * Rebinning of the grid of input data is performed by transforming
     * the coordinates of the centre of each input grid element (or pixel)
     * into the coordinate system of the output grid. The input pixel
     * value is then divided up and assigned to the output pixels in the
     * neighbourhood of the central output coordinates. A choice of
     * schemes are provided for determining how each input pixel value is
     * divided up between the output pixels. In general, each output pixel 
     * may be assigned values from more than one input pixel. All 
     * contributions to a given output pixel are summed to produce the
     * final output pixel value. Output pixels can be set to the supplied
     * bad value if they receive contributions from an insufficient number
     * of input pixels. This is controlled by the 
     * "wlim" parameter.
     * <p>
     * Input pixel coordinates are transformed into the coordinate
     * system of the output grid using the forward transformation of the
     * Mapping which is supplied. This means that geometrical features
     * in the input data are subjected to the Mapping's forward
     * transformation as they are transferred from the input to the
     * output grid.
     * <p>
     * In practice, transforming the coordinates of every pixel of a
     * large data grid can be time-consuming, especially if the Mapping
     * involves complicated functions, such as sky projections. To
     * improve performance, it is therefore possible to approximate
     * non-linear Mappings by a set of linear transformations which are
     * applied piece-wise to separate sub-regions of the data. This
     * approximation process is applied automatically by an adaptive
     * algorithm, under control of an accuracy criterion which
     * expresses the maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may
     * be introduced, as a fraction of a pixel.
     * <p>
     * This algorithm first attempts to approximate the Mapping with a
     * linear transformation applied over the whole region of the
     * input grid which is being used. If this proves to be
     * insufficiently accurate, the input region is sub-divided into
     * two along its largest dimension and the process is repeated
     * within each of the resulting sub-regions. This process of
     * sub-division continues until a sufficiently good linear
     * approximation is found, or the region to which it is being
     * applied becomes too small (in which case the original Mapping is
     * used directly).
     * <h4>Pixel Spreading Schemes</h4>
     * The pixel spreading scheme specifies the Point Spread Function (PSF) 
     * applied to each input pixel value as it is copied into the output 
     * array. It can be thought of as the inverse of the sub-pixel 
     * interpolation schemes used by the
     * astResample<X> 
     * group of functions. That is, in a sub-pixel interpolation scheme the 
     * kernel specifies the weight to assign to each input pixel when
     * forming the weighted mean of the input pixels, whereas the kernel in a 
     * pixel spreading scheme specifies the fraction of the input data value 
     * which is to be assigned to each output pixel. As for interpolation, the 
     * choice of suitable pixel spreading scheme involves stricking a balance 
     * between schemes which tend to degrade sharp features in the data by 
     * smoothing them, and those which attempt to preserve sharp features but 
     * which often tend to introduce unwanted artifacts. See the
     * astResample<X> 
     * documentation for further discussion.
     * <p>
     * The binning algorithm used has the ability to introduce artifacts
     * not seen when using a resampling algorithm. Particularly, when
     * viewing the output image at high contrast, systems of curves lines
     * covering the entire image may be visible. These are caused by a
     * beating effect between the input pixel positions and the output pixels
     * position, and their nature and strength depend critically upon the
     * nature of the Mapping and the spreading function being used. In
     * general, the nearest neighbour spreading function demonstrates this
     * effect more clearly than the other functions, and for this reason
     * should be used with caution.
     * <p>
     * The following values (defined in the 
     * "ast.h" header file)
     * may be assigned to the 
     * "spread" 
     * parameter. See the 
     * astResample<X> 
     * documentation for details of these schemes including the use of the 
     * "fspread" and "params" parameters:
     * <p>
     * <br> - AST__NEAREST
     * <br> - AST__LINEAR
     * <br> - AST__SINC
     * <br> - AST__SINCSINC
     * <br> - AST__SINCCOS
     * <br> - AST__SINCGAUSS
     * <br> - AST__SOMBCOS
     * <p>
     * In addition, the following schemes can be used with 
     * astRebin<X> but not with astResample<X>:
     * <p>
     * <br> - AST__GAUSS: This scheme uses a kernel of the form exp(-k*x*x), with k 
     * a positive constant determined by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM).
     * The FWHM should be supplied in units of output pixels by means of the 
     * "params[1]"
     * value and should be at least 0.1. The 
     * "params[0]" 
     * value should be used to specify at what point the Gaussian is truncated 
     * to zero. This should be given as a number of output pixels on either 
     * side of the central output point in each dimension (the nearest integer 
     * value is used).
     * <h4>Propagation of Missing Data</h4>
     * Instances of missing data (bad pixels) in the output grid are
     * identified by occurrences of the "badval" value in the "out"
     * array. These are produced if the sum of the weights of the 
     * contributing input pixels is less than 
     * "wlim".
     * <p>
     * An input pixel is considered bad (and is consequently ignored) if 
     * its
     * data value is equal to "badval" and the AST__USEBAD flag is
     * set via the "flags" parameter.
     * <p>
     * In addition, associated output variance estimates (if
     * calculated) may be declared bad and flagged with the "badval"
     * value in the "out_var" array for similar reasons.
     * @param   wlim
     * Gives the required number of input pixel values which must contribute
     * to an output pixel in order for the output pixel value to be
     * considered valid. If the sum of the input pixel weights contributing 
     * to an output pixel is less than the supplied
     * "wlim"
     * value, then the output pixel value is returned set to the
     * supplied bad value.
     * 
     * @param   ndim_in
     * The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
     * least one.
     * 
     * @param   lbnd_in
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
     * in the input grid along each dimension.

     * containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
     * the input grid along each dimension.
     * <p>
     * Note that "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" together define the shape
     * and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
     * (j'th) dimension being ubnd_in[j]-lbnd_in[j]+1 (assuming the
     * index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
     * the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
     * extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
     * at its centre.
     * 
     * @param   in
     * Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
     * input grid, containing the input data to be rebined.  The
     * numerical type of this array should match the 1- or
     * 2-character type code appended to the function name (e.g. if
     * you are using astRebinF, the type of each array element
     * should be "float").
     * <p>
     * The storage order of data within this array should be such
     * that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
     * rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
     * (i.e. Fortran array indexing is used).
     * 
     * @param   in_var
     * An optional pointer to a second array with the same size and
     * type as the "in" array. If given, this should contain a set
     * of non-negative values which represent estimates of the
     * statistical variance associated with each element of the "in"
     * array. If this array is supplied (together with the
     * corresponding "out_var" array), then estimates of the
     * variance of the rebined output data will be calculated.
     * <p>
     * If no input variance estimates are being provided, a NULL
     * pointer should be given.
     * 
     * @param   spread
     * a <code>Spreader</code> object which determines how each
     *             input data value is divided up amongst the corresponding
     *             output pixels
     *          
     * @param   usebad
     * if true, indicates that there may be bad
     *             pixels in the input array(s) which must be
     *             recognised by comparing with the value given for
     *             <code>badval</code> and propagated to the
     *             output array(s). If
     *             this flag is not set, all input values are treated
     *             literally and the <code>badval</code>
     *             value is only used for
     *             flagging output array values.
     *          
     * @param   tol
     * The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
     * introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings
     * by a set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
     * expressed as a displacement in pixels in the output grid's
     * coordinate system.
     * <p>
     * If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
     * of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is
     * used without any approximation, but may increase execution
     * time.
     * <p>
     * If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear
     * approximations used in adjacent panel will be higher, and may
     * cause the edges of the panel to be visible when viewing the output 
     * image at high contrast. If this is a problem, reduce the
     * tolerance value used.
     * 
     * @param   maxpix
     * A value which specifies an initial scale size (in pixels) for
     * the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
     * with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
     * be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
     * the input grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
     * approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
     * made over the entire input region.
     * <p>
     * If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be
     * divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
     * pixels in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts at
     * approximation commence.
     * <p>
     * This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
     * convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
     * Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
     * irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
     * say, 50 to 100 pixels can also be employed as a safeguard in
     * general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
     * minimal.
     * <p>
     * If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
     * inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
     * setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
     * performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
     * 
     * @param   badval
     * This argument should have the same type as the elements of
     * the "in" array. It specifies the value used to flag missing
     * data (bad pixels) in the input and output arrays.
     * <p>
     * If the AST__USEBAD flag is set via the "flags" parameter,
     * then this value is used to test for bad pixels in the "in"
     * (and "in_var") array(s).
     * <p>
     * In all cases, this value is also used to flag any output
     * elements in the "out" (and "out_var") array(s) for which
     * rebined values could not be obtained (see the "Propagation
     * of Missing Data" section below for details of the
     * circumstances under which this may occur). 
     * 
     * @param   ndim_out
     * The number of dimensions in the output grid. This should be
     * at least one. It need not necessarily be equal to the number
     * of dimensions in the input grid.
     * 
     * @param   lbnd_out
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
     * in the output grid along each dimension.
     * 
     * @param   ubnd_out
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_out" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
     * the output grid along each dimension.
     * <p>
     * Note that "lbnd_out" and "ubnd_out" together define the
     * shape, size and coordinate system of the output grid in the
     * same way as "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" define the shape, size
     * and coordinate system of the input grid.
     * 
     * @param   lbnd
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the first pixel in the region
     * of the input grid which is to be included in the rebined output
     * array.
     * 
     * @param   ubnd
     * Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim_in" elements,
     * containing the coordinates of the last pixel in the region of
     * the input grid which is to be included in the rebined output
     * array.
     * <p>
     * Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" together define the shape and
     * position of a (hyper-)rectangular region of the input grid
     * which is to be included in the rebined output array. This region
     * should lie wholly within the extent of the input grid (as
     * defined by the "lbnd_in" and "ubnd_in" arrays). Regions of
     * the input grid lying outside this region will not be used.
     * 
     * @param   out
     * Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
     * output grid, in which the rebined data values will be
     * returned. The numerical type of this array should match that
     * of the "in" array, and the data storage order should be such
     * that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
     * rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
     * (i.e. Fortran array indexing is used).
     * 
     * @param   out_var
     * An optional pointer to an array with the same type and size
     * as the "out" array. If given, this array will be used to
     * return variance estimates for the rebined data values. This
     * array will only be used if the "in_var" array has also been
     * supplied.
     * <p>
     * The output variance values will be calculated on the
     * assumption that errors on the input data values are
     * statistically independent and that their variance estimates
     * may simply be summed (with appropriate weighting factors)
     * when several input pixels contribute to an output data
     * value. If this assumption is not valid, then the output error
     * estimates may be biased. In addition, note that the
     * statistical errors on neighbouring output data values (as
     * well as the estimates of those errors) may often be
     * correlated, even if the above assumption about the input data
     * is correct, because of the pixel spreading schemes
     * employed.
     * <p>
     * If no output variance estimates are required, a NULL pointer
     * should be given.
     *

     * the input grid along each dimension.
     * <p>
     * Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" together define the shape
     * and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
     * (j'th) dimension being ubnd[j]-lbnd[j]+1 (assuming the
     * index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
     * the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
     * extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
     * at its centre.
     * 
     * @param   tol
     * The maximum tolerable geometrical distortion which may be
     * introduced as a result of approximating non-linear Mappings
     * by a set of piece-wise linear transformations. This should be
     * expressed as a displacement within the output coordinate system
     * of the Mapping.
     * <p>
     * If piece-wise linear approximation is not required, a value
     * of zero may be given. This will ensure that the Mapping is
     * used without any approximation, but may increase execution
     * time.
     * <p>
     * If the value is too high, discontinuities between the linear
     * approximations used in adjacent panel will be higher. If this 
     * is a problem, reduce the tolerance value used.
     * 
     * @param   maxpix
     * A value which specifies an initial scale size (in input grid points) 
     * for the adaptive algorithm which approximates non-linear Mappings
     * with piece-wise linear transformations. Normally, this should
     * be a large value (larger than any dimension of the region of
     * the input grid being used). In this case, a first attempt to
     * approximate the Mapping by a linear transformation will be
     * made over the entire input region.
     * <p>
     * If a smaller value is used, the input region will first be
     * divided into sub-regions whose size does not exceed "maxpix"
     * grid points in any dimension. Only at this point will attempts
     * at approximation commence.
     * <p>
     * This value may occasionally be useful in preventing false
     * convergence of the adaptive algorithm in cases where the
     * Mapping appears approximately linear on large scales, but has
     * irregularities (e.g. holes) on smaller scales. A value of,
     * say, 50 to 100 grid points can also be employed as a safeguard 
     * in general-purpose software, since the effect on performance is
     * minimal.
     * <p>
     * If too small a value is given, it will have the effect of
     * inhibiting linear approximation altogether (equivalent to
     * setting "tol" to zero). Although this may degrade
     * performance, accurate results will still be obtained.
     * 
     * @param   forward
     * A non-zero value indicates that the Mapping's forward
     * coordinate transformation is to be applied, while a zero
     * value indicates that the inverse transformation should be
     * used.
     * 
     * @param   ncoord_out
     * The number of coordinates being generated by the Mapping for
     * each output point (i.e. the number of dimensions of the
     * space in which the output points reside). This need not be
     * the same as "ncoord_in".
     * 
     * @return  The address of the first element in a 2-dimensional array of 
     * shape "[ncoord_out][outdim]", into
     * which the coordinates of the output (transformed) points will
     * be written. These will be stored such that the value of
     * coordinate number "coord" for output point number "point"
     * will be found in element "out[coord][point]".
     * The points are ordered such that the first axis of the input
     * grid changes most rapidly. For example, if the input grid is 
     * 2-dimensional and extends from (2,-1) to (3,1), the output
     * points will be stored in the order (2,-1), (3, -1), (2,0), (3,0),
