/**
 * Java interface to the AST LutMap class
 *  - transform 1-dimensional coordinates using a lookup table. 
 * A LutMap is a specialised form of Mapping which transforms
 * 1-dimensional coordinates by using linear interpolation in a
 * lookup table.
 * <p>
 * Each input coordinate value is first scaled to give the index of
 * an entry in the table by subtracting a starting value (the input
 * coordinate corresponding to the first table entry) and dividing
 * by an increment (the difference in input coordinate value
 * between adjacent table entries).
 * <p>
 * The resulting index will usually contain a fractional part, so
 * the output coordinate value is then generated by interpolating
 * linearly between the appropriate entries in the table. If the
 * index lies outside the range of the table, linear extrapolation
 * is used based on the two nearest entries (i.e. the two entries
 * at the start or end of the table, as appropriate). If either of the
 * entries used for the interplation has a value of AST__BAD, then the 
 * interpolated value is returned as AST__BAD.
 * <p>
 * If the lookup table entries increase or decrease monotonically (and
 * if the table contains no AST__BAD values), then the inverse 
 * transformation may also be performed.
