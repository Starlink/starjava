/**
 * Java interface to the AST SwitchMap class
 *  - a Mapping that encapsulates a set of alternate Mappings. 
 * A SwitchMap is a Mapping which represents a set of alternate
 * Mappings, each of which is used to transform positions within a 
 * particular region of the input or output coordinate system of the 
 * SwitchMap.
 * <p>
 * A SwitchMap can encapsulate any number of Mappings, but they must
 * all have the same number of inputs (Nin attribute value) and the 
 * same number of outputs (Nout attribute value). The SwitchMap itself 
 * inherits these same values for its Nin and Nout attributes. Each of
 * these Mappings represents a "route" through the switch, and are
 * referred to as "route" Mappings below. Each route Mapping transforms 
 * positions between the input and output coordinate space of the entire 
 * SwitchMap, but only one Mapping will be used to transform any given
 * position. The selection of the appropriate route Mapping to use with 
 * any given input position is made by another Mapping, called the
 * "selector" Mapping. Each SwitchMap encapsulates two selector
 * Mappings in addition to its route Mappings; one for use with the
 * SwitchMap's forward transformation (called the "forward selector
 * Mapping"), and one for use with the SwitchMap's inverse transformation 
 * (called the "inverse selector Mapping"). The forward selector Mapping
 * must have the same number of inputs as the route Mappings, but
 * should have only one output. Likewise, the inverse selector Mapping
 * must have the same number of outputs as the route Mappings, but
 * should have only one input. 
 * <p>
 * When the SwitchMap is used to transform a position in the forward
 * direction (from input to output), each supplied input position is
 * first transformed by the forward transformation of the forward selector 
 * Mapping. This produces a single output value for each input position 
 * referred to as the selector value. The nearest integer to the selector 
 * value is found, and is used to index the array of route Mappings (the 
 * first supplied route Mapping has index 1, the second route Mapping has 
 * index 2, etc). If the nearest integer to the selector value is less 
 * than 1 or greater than the number of route Mappings, then the SwitchMap 
 * output position is set to a value of AST__BAD on every axis. Otherwise, 
 * the forward transformation of the selected route Mapping is used to 
 * transform the supplied input position to produce the SwitchMap output 
 * position. 
 * <p>
 * When the SwitchMap is used to transform a position in the inverse
 * direction (from "output" to "input"), each supplied "output" position 
 * is first transformed by the inverse transformation of the inverse 
 * selector Mapping. This produces a selector value for each "output" 
 * position. Again, the nearest integer to the selector value is found, 
 * and is used to index the array of route Mappings. If this selector 
 * index value is within the bounds of the array of route Mappings, then 
 * the inverse transformation of the selected route Mapping is used to 
 * transform the supplied "output" position to produce the SwitchMap 
 * "input" position. If the selector index value is outside the bounds 
 * of the array of route Mappings, then the SwitchMap "input" position is 
 * set to a value of AST__BAD on every axis. 
 * <p>
 * In practice, appropriate selector Mappings should be chosen to
 * associate a different route Mapping with each region of coordinate 
 * space. Note that the SelectorMap class of Mapping is particularly 
 * appropriate for this purpose.
 * <p>
 * If a compound Mapping contains a SwitchMap in series with its own
 * inverse, the combination of the two adjacent SwitchMaps will be 
 * replaced by a UnitMap when the compound Mapping is simplified using
 * astSimplify.
