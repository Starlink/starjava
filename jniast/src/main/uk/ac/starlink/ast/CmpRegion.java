/**
 * Java interface to the AST CmpRegion class
 *  - a combination of two regions within a single Frame. 
 * A CmpRegion is a Region which allows two component
 * Regions (of any class) to be combined to form a more complex 
 * Region. This combination may be performed either a boolean 
 * AND operator or a boolean OR operator. If the AND operator is 
 * used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion only if it is 
 * inside both of its two component Regions. If the OR operator is 
 * used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside 
 * either (or both) of its two component Regions. Other operators can
 * be formed by negating one or both component Regions before using 
 * them to construct a new CmpRegion.
 * <p>
 * The two component Region need not refer to the same coordinate
 * Frame, but it must be possible for the 
 * astConvert 
 * function to determine a Mapping between them (an error will be
 * reported otherwise when the CmpRegion is created). For instance,
 * a CmpRegion may combine a Region defined within an ICRS SkyFrame
 * with a Region defined within a Galactic SkyFrame. This is
 * acceptable because the SkyFrame class knows how to convert between
 * these two systems, and consequently the 
 * astConvert 
 * function will also be able to convert between them. In such cases,
 * the second component Region will be mapped into the coordinate Frame
 * of the first component Region, and the Frame represented by the 
 * CmpRegion as a whole will be the Frame of the first component Region.
 * <p>
 * Since a CmpRegion is itself a Region, it can be used as a
 * component in forming further CmpRegions. Regions of arbitrary
 * complexity may be built from simple individual Regions in this
 * way.

     * <h4>Notes</h4>
     * <br> - If one of the supplied Regions has an associated uncertainty,
     * that uncertainty will also be used for the returned CmpRegion.
     * If both supplied Regions have associated uncertainties, the
     * uncertainty associated with the first Region will be used for the 
     * returned CmpRegion.
     * <br> - Deep copies are taken of the supplied Regions. This means that
     * any subsequent changes made to the component Regions using the 
     * supplied pointers will have no effect on the CmpRegion.
     * <br> - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
     * function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
     * should fail for any reason.
     * @param  region1  Pointer to the first component Region.
     * 
     * @param  region2  Pointer to the second component Region. This Region will be
     * transformed into the coordinate Frame of the first region before 
     * use. An error will be reported if this is not possible.
     * 
     * @param  oper  The boolean operator with which to combine the two Regions. This
     * must be one of the symbolic constants AST__AND or AST__OR.
     * 
     * @throws  AstException  if an error occurred in the AST library
