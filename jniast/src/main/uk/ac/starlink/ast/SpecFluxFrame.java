/**
 * Java interface to the AST SpecFluxFrame class
 *  - compound spectrum/flux Frame. 
 * A SpecFluxFrame combines a SpecFrame and a FluxFrame into a single 
 * 2-dimensional compound Frame. Such a Frame can for instance be used
 * to describe a Plot of a spectrum in which the first axis represents
 * spectral position and the second axis represents flux.
