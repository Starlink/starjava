/**
 * Java interface to the AST Frame class
 *  - coordinate system description. 
 * This class is used to represent coordinate systems. It does this
 * in rather the same way that a frame around a graph describes the
 * coordinate space in which data are plotted. Consequently, a
 * Frame has a Title (string) attribute, which describes the
 * coordinate space, and contains axes which in turn hold
 * information such as Label and Units strings which are used for
 * labelling (e.g.) graphical output. In general, however, the
 * number of axes is not restricted to two.
 * <p>
 * Functions are available for converting Frame coordinate values
 * into a form suitable for display, and also for calculating
 * distances and offsets between positions within the Frame.
 * <p>
 * Frames may also contain knowledge of how to transform to and
 * from related coordinate systems.
 * <h4>Notes</h4>
 * <br> - When used as a Mapping, a Frame implements a unit (null)
 * transformation in both the forward and inverse directions
 * (equivalent to a UnitMap). The Nin and Nout attribute values are
 * both equal to the number of Frame axes.

     * use only of an intermediate coordinate system whose Domain
     * attribute matches the first domain in this list. If this
     * fails, the second domain in the list will be used, and so on,

     * you should supply an empty string. This is normally
     * appropriate if either of the source or destination coordinate
     * systems are described by Frames (rather than FrameSets),

     * intermediate coordinate system.
     * 
     * @return  If the requested coordinate conversion is possible, the

     * user's preference for a particular coordinate system (for
     * example, what type of axes to draw) with what is actually
     * possible given the coordinate information available.
     * <p>
     * To perform a search, you supply a "target" Frame (or FrameSet)
     * which represents the set of coordinate systems to be searched.
     * If a basic Frame is given as the target, this set of coordinate
     * systems consists of the one described by this Frame, plus all
     * other "virtual" coordinate systems which can potentially be
     * reached from it by applying built-in conversions (for example,
     * any of the celestial coordinate conversions known to the AST
     * library would constitute a "built-in" conversion). If a FrameSet
     * is given as the target, the set of coordinate systems to be
     * searched consists of the union of those represented by all the
     * individual Frames within it.
     * <p>
     * To select from this large set of possible coordinate systems,
     * you supply a "template" Frame which is an instance of the type
     * of Frame you are looking for. Effectively, you then ask the
     * function to "find a coordinate system that looks like this".
     * <p>
     * You can make your request more or less specific by setting
     * attribute values for the template Frame. If a particular
     * attribute is set in the template, then the function will only
     * find coordinate systems which have exactly the same value for
     * that attribute.  If you leave a template attribute un-set,
     * however, then the function has discretion about the value the
     * attribute should have in any coordinate system it finds. The
     * attribute will then take its value from one of the actual
     * (rather than virtual) coordinate systems in the target. If the
     * target is a FrameSet, its Current attribute will be modified to
     * indicate which of its Frames was used for this purpose.
     * <p>
     * The result of this process is a coordinate system represented by
     * a hybrid Frame which acquires some attributes from the template
     * (but only if they were set) and the remainder from the
     * target. This represents the "best compromise" between what you
     * asked for and what was available. A Mapping is then generated
     * which converts from the target coordinate system to this hybrid
     * one, and the returned FrameSet encapsulates all of this
     * information.
     * <h4>Notes</h4>
     * <br> -  The Mapping represented by the returned FrameSet results in
     * alignment taking place in the coordinate system specified by the
     * AlignSystem attribute of the "template" Frame. See the description
     * of the AlignSystem attribute for further details.
     * <br> - Beware of setting the Domain attribute of the template and then
     * using a "domainlist" string which does not include the template's domain
     * (or a blank field). If you do so, no coordinate system will be
     * found.
     * <br> - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
     * function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
     * should fail for any reason.
     * <h4>More on Using Templates</h4>
     * A Frame (describing a coordinate system) will be found by this
     * function if (a) it is "matched" by the template you supply, and
     * (b) the value of its Domain attribute appears in the "domainlist"
     * string (except that a blank field in this string permits any
     * domain). A successful match by the template depends on a number
     * of criteria, as outlined below:
     * <br> - In general, a template will only match another Frame which
     * belongs to the same class as the template, or to a derived (more
     * specialised) class. For example, a SkyFrame template will match
     * any other SkyFrame, but will not match a basic
     * Frame. Conversely, a basic Frame template will match any class
     * of Frame.
     * <br> - The exception to this is that a Frame of any class can be used to
     * match a CmpFrame, if that CmpFrame contains a Frame of the same
     * class as the template. Note however, the MaxAxes and MinAxes
     * attributes of the template must be set to suitable values to allow
     * it to match the CmpFrame. That is, the MinAxes attribute must be
     * less than or equal to the number of axes in the target, and the MaxAxes 
     * attribute must be greater than or equal to the number of axes in
     * the target.
     * <br> - If using a CmpFrame as a template frame, the MinAxes and MaxAxes 
     * for the template are determined by the MinAxes and MaxAxes values of 
     * the component Frames within the template. So if you want a template 
     * CmpFrame to be able to match Frames with different numbers of axes,
     * then you must set the MaxAxes and/or MinAxes attributes in the component
     * template Frames, before combining them together into the template 
     * CmpFrame.
     * <br> - If a template has a value set for any of its main attributes, then
     * it will only match Frames which have an identical value for that
     * attribute (or which can be transformed, using a built-in
     * conversion, so that they have the required value for that
     * attribute). If any attribute in the template is un-set, however,
     * then Frames are matched regardless of the value they may have
     * for that attribute. You may therefore make a template more or
     * less specific by choosing the attributes for which you set
     * values. This requirement does not apply to 'descriptive' attributes
     * such as titles, labels, symbols, etc.
     * <br> - An important application of this principle involves the Domain
     * attribute. Setting the Domain attribute of the template has the
     * effect of restricting the search to a particular type of Frame
     * (with the domain you specify).  Conversely, if the Domain
     * attribute is not set in the template, then the domain of the
     * Frame found is not relevant, so all Frames are searched.  Note
     * that the
     * "domainlist" string provides an alternative way of restricting the
     * search in the same manner, but is a more convenient interface if
     * you wish to search automatically for another domain if the first
     * search fails.
     * <br> - Normally, a template will only match a Frame which has the
     * same number of axes as itself. However, for some classes of
     * template, this default behaviour may be changed by means of the

     * found. The Mapping which inter-relates these two Frames will
     * describe how to convert between their respective coordinate
     * systems.

     * them which introduces a scaling of 1000. If no Mapping can be found
     * between the corresponding units string, then an error is reported.
     * In this mode, it is assumed that values of the Unit attribute conform
     * to the syntax for units strings described in the FITS WCS Paper I
     * "Representations of world coordinates in FITS" (Greisen & Calabretta).
     * Particularly, any of the named unit symbols, functions, operators or

     * using a lower case "a" at the start of "angstrom", "micron" instead of 
     * "um", "sec" instead of "s", etc.
     * <p>
     * If the ActiveUnit flag is non-zero, setting a new Unit value for an
     * axis may also change its Label and Symbol attributes. For instance, if
     * an axis has Unit "Hz" and Label "frequency", then changing its Unit to
     * "log(Hz)" will change its Label to "log( frequency )". In addition,

     * <br> - -.99e-17
     * <br> - <bad>
     * <h4>SkyFrame Input Format</h4>
     * The input format accepted for a SkyFrame axis is as follows:
     * <br> - An optional sign, followed by between one and three fields
     * representing either degrees, arc-minutes, arc-seconds or hours,
     * minutes, seconds (e.g. "-12 42 03").
     * <br> - Each field should consist of a sequence of one or more digits,
     * which may include leading zeros. At most one field may contain a
     * decimal point, in which case it is taken to be the final field
     * (e.g. decimal degrees might be given as "124.707", while degrees
     * and decimal arc-minutes might be given as "-13 33.8").

     * times outside the conventional ranges to be
     * represented. However, subsequent fields must have values of less
     * than 60 (e.g. "720 45 31" is valid, whereas "11 45 61" is not).
     * <br> - Fields may be separated by white space or by ":" (colon), but
     * the choice of separator must be used consistently throughout the
     * value. Additional white space may be present around fields and
     * separators (e.g. "- 2: 04 : 7.1").
     * <br> - The following field identification characters may be used as
     * separators to replace either of those above (or may be appended
     * to the final field), in order to identify the field to which
     * they are appended: "d"---degrees; "h"---hours; "m"---minutes of
     * arc or time; "s"---seconds of arc or time; "'" (single
     * quote)---minutes of arc; """ (double quote)---seconds of arc.
     * Either lower or upper case may be used.  Fields must be given in
     * order of decreasing significance (e.g. "-11D 3' 14.4"" or
     * "22h14m11.2s").
     * <br> - The presence of any of the field identification characters
     * "d", "'" (single quote) or """ (double quote) indicates that the
     * value is to be interpreted as an angle. Conversely, the presence
     * of "h" indicates that it is to be interpreted as a time (with 24
     * hours corresponding to 360 degrees). Incompatible angle/time
     * identification characters may not be mixed (e.g. "10h14'3"" is
     * not valid).  The remaining field identification characters and
     * separators do not specify a preference for an angle or a time
     * and may be used with either.
     * <br> - If no preference for an angle or a time is expressed anywhere
     * within the value, it is interpreted as an angle if the Format
     * attribute string associated with the SkyFrame axis generates an
     * angle and as a time otherwise. This ensures that values produced
     * by astFormat are correctly interpreted by astUnformat.
     * <br> - Fields may be omitted, in which case they default to zero. The
     * remaining fields may be identified by using appropriate field
     * identification characters (see above) and/or by adding extra
     * colon separators (e.g. "-05m13s" is equivalent to "-:05:13"). If
     * a field is not identified explicitly, it is assumed that
     * adjacent fields have been given, after taking account of any
     * extra separator characters (e.g. "14:25.4s" specifies minutes
     * and seconds, while "14::25.4s" specifies degrees and seconds).
     * <br> - If fields are omitted in such a way that the remaining ones
     * cannot be identified uniquely (e.g. "01:02"), then the first
     * field (either given explicitly or implied by an extra leading
     * colon separator) is taken to be the most significant field that
     * astFormat would produce when formatting a value (using the
     * Format attribute associated with the SkyFrame axis).  By
     * default, this means that the first field will normally be
     * interpreted as degrees or hours. However, if this does not
     * result in consistent field identification, then the last field
     * (either given explicitly or implied by an extra trailing colon
     * separator) is taken to to be the least significant field that
     * astFormat would produce.
     * <p>
     * This final convention is intended to ensure that values formatted
     * by astFormat which contain less than three fields will be
     * correctly interpreted if read back using astUnformat, even if
     * they do not contain field identification characters.
     * <p>
     * Examples of acceptable SkyFrame input formats (with
     * interpretation in parentheses) include:
     * <br> - -14d 13m 22.2s (-14d 13' 22.2")
     * <br> - + 12:34:56.7 (12d 34' 56.7" or 12h 34m 56.7s)
     * <br> - 001 : 02 : 03.4 (1d 02' 03.4" or 1h 02m 03.4s)
     * <br> - 22h 30 (22h 30m 00s)
     * <br> - 136::10" (136d 00' 10" or 136h 00m 10s)
     * <br> - -14M 27S (-0d 14' 27" or -0h 14m 27s)
     * <br> - -:14: (-0d 14' 00" or -0h 14m 00s)
     * <br> - -::4.1 (-0d 00' 04.1" or -0h 00m 04.1s)
     * <br> - .9" (0d 00' 00.9")
     * <br> - d12m (0d 12' 00")
     * <br> - H 12:22.3s (0h 12m 22.3s)
     * <br> - <bad> (AST__BAD)
     * <p>
     * Where alternative interpretations are shown, the choice of angle or
     * time depends on the associated Format(axis) attribute.
     * <h4>Notes</h4>
     * <br> - A function value of zero (and no coordinate value) will be
     * returned, without error, if the string supplied does not contain
     * a suitably formatted value.
     * <br> - Beware that it is possible for a formatting error part-way
     * through an input string to terminate input before it has been
     * completely read, but to yield a coordinate value that appears
     * valid. For example, if a user types "1.5r6" instead of "1.5e6",
     * the "r" will terminate input, giving an incorrect coordinate
     * value of 1.5. It is therefore most important to check the return
     * value of this function to ensure that the correct number of
     * characters have been read.
     * <br> - An error will result if a value is read which appears to have
     * the correct format, but which cannot be converted into a valid
     * coordinate value (for instance, because the value of one or more
     * of its fields is invalid).
     * <br> - The string "<bad>" is recognised as a special case and will
     * yield the coordinate value AST__BAD without error. The test for
     * this string is case-insensitive and also permits embedded white
     * space.
     * <br> - A function result of zero will be returned and no coordinate
     * value will be returned via the "value" pointer if this function
     * is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it should fail
     * for any reason.
     * @param   axis

     * formatted coordinate value.
     * This string may contain additional information following the

     * <dt>CmpFrame</dt><dd>
     *    The default Epoch value for a CmpFrame is selected as follows;

     *    The coordinates of sources within a SkyFrame can changed with time
     *    for various reasons, including: (i) changing aberration of light
     *    caused by the observer's velocity (e.g. due to the Earth's motion
     *    around the Sun), (ii) changing gravitational deflection by the Sun
     *    due to changes in the observer's position with time, (iii) fictitious
     *    motion due to rotation of non-inertial coordinate systems (e.g. the
     *    old FK4 system), and (iv) proper motion of the source itself (although
     *    this last effect is not handled by the SkyFrame class because it
     *    affects individual sources rather than the coordinate system as
     *    a whole).
     * <p>
     *    The default Epoch value in a SkyFrame is B1950.0 (Besselian) for the
     *    old FK4-based coordinate systems (see the System attribute) and
     *    J2000.0 (Julian) for all others.
     * <p>
     *    Care must be taken to distinguish the Epoch value, which relates to
     *    motion (or apparent motion) of the source, from the superficially
     *    similar Equinox value. The latter is used to qualify a coordinate
     *    system which is itself in motion in a (notionally) predictable way
     *    as a result of being referred to a slowly moving reference plane
     *    (e.g. the equator).
     * <p>
     *    See the description of the System attribute for details of which
     *    qualifying attributes apply to each celestial coordinate system.
     * <dt>TimeFrame</dt><dd>
     *    A TimeFrame describes a general time axis and so cannot be completely 
     *    characterised by a single Epoch value. For this reason the TimeFrame

     * The Format string supplied for a SkyFrame should contain zero or
     * more of the following characters. These may occur in any order,
     * but the following is recommended for clarity:
     * <p>
     * <br> - "+": Indicates that a plus sign should be prefixed to positive

     * value so that the first field is of constant width, as would be
     * required in a fixed-width table (leading zeros are always
     * prefixed to any fields that follow). By default, no leading
     * zeros are added.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "i": Use the standard ISO field separator (a colon) between
     * fields. This is the default behaviour.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "b": Use a blank to separate fields.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "l": Use a letter ("h"/"d", "m" or "s" as appropriate) to
     * separate fields.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "g": Use a letter and symbols to separate fields ("h"/"d", "m" or "s",
     * etc, as appropriate), but include escape sequences in the formatted 
     * value so that the Plot class will draw the separators as small
     * super-scripts.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "d": Include a degrees field. Expressing the angle purely in
     * degrees is also the default if none of "h", "m", "s" or "t" are
     * given.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "h": Express the angle as a time and include an hours field
     * (where 24 hours correspond to 360 degrees). Expressing the angle
     * purely in hours is also the default if "t" is given without
     * either "m" or "s".
     * <p>
     * <br> - "m": Include a minutes field. By default this is not included.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "s": Include a seconds field. By default this is not included.
     * This request is ignored if "d" or "h" is given, unless a minutes
     * field is also included.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "t": Express the angle as a time (where 24 hours correspond to
     * 360 degrees). This option is ignored if either "d" or "h" is
     * given and is intended for use where the value is to be expressed
     * purely in minutes and/or seconds of time (with no hours
     * field). If "t" is given without "d", "h", "m" or "s" being
     * present, then it is equivalent to "h".
     * <p>
     * <br> - ".": Indicates that decimal places are to be given for the
     * final field in the formatted string (whichever field this
     * is). The "." should be followed immediately by an unsigned
     * integer which gives the number of decimal places required, or by an
     * asterisk. If an asterisk is supplied, a default number of decimal
     * places is used which is based on the value of the Digits 
     * attribute. 
     * <p>
     * All of the above format specifiers are case-insensitive. If
     * several characters make conflicting requests (e.g. if both "i"
     * and "b" appear), then the character occurring last takes
     * precedence, except that "d" and "h" always override "t".
     * <p>
     * If the format string starts with a percentage sign (%), then the 
     * whole format string is assumed to conform to the syntax defined by
     * the Frame class, and the axis values is formated as a decimal
     * radians value.
     * <h4>TimeFrame Formats</h4>
     * The Format string supplied for a TimeFrame should either use the
     * syntax defined by the base Frame class (i.e. a C "printf" format
     * string), or the extended "iso" syntax described below (the default
     * value is inherited from the Frame class):
     * <p>
     * <br> - C "printf" syntax: If the Format string is a C "printf" format
     * description such as "%1.7G", the TimeFrame axis value will be
     * formatted without change as a floating point value using this format.
     * The formatted string will thus represent an offset from the zero point 
     * specified by the TimeFrame's TimeOrigin attribute, measured in
     * units given by the TimeFrame's Unit attribute.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "iso" syntax: This is used to format a TimeFrame axis value as a
     * Gregorian date followed by an optional time of day. If the Format
     * value commences with the string "iso" then the TimeFrame axis value
     * will be converted to an absolute MJD, including the addition of the 
     * current TimeOrigin value, and then formatted as a Gregorian date 
     * using the format "yyyy-mm-dd". Optionally, the Format value may
     * include an integer precision following the "iso" specification (e.g. 
     * "iso.2"), in which case the time of day will be appended to the 
     * formatted date (if no time of day is included, the date field is
     * rounded to the nearest day). The integer value in the Format string 
     * indicates the number of decimal places to use in the seconds field. For 
     * instance, a Format value of "iso.0" produces a time of day of the form 
     * "hh:mm:ss", and a Format value of "iso.2" produces a time of day of the 
     * form "hh:mm:ss.ss". The date and time fields will be separated by a 
     * space. The value of the Digits attribute is ignored when using this 
     * "iso" format. 
     * <h4>Notes</h4>
     * <br> - When specifying this attribute by name, it should be
     * subscripted with the number of the Frame axis to which it
     * applies.
     * <h4>Class Applicability</h4>
     * <dl>
     * <dt>Frame</dt><dd>
     *    The Frame class interprets this attribute as a format
     *    specification string to be passed to the C "printf" function
     *    (e.g. "%1.7G") in order to format a single coordinate value
     *    (supplied as a double precision number).
     * <p>
     *    When supplying a value for this attribute, beware that the
     *    "%" character may be interpreted directly as a format
     *    specification by some printf-like functions (such as
     *    astSet). You may need to double it (i.e. use "%%") to avoid
     *    this.
     * <dt>SkyFrame</dt><dd>
     *    The SkyFrame class re-defines the syntax and default value of
     *    the Format string to allow the formatting of sexagesimal
     *    values as appropriate for the particular celestial coordinate
     *    system being represented. The syntax of SkyFrame Format
     *    strings is described (below) in the "SkyFrame Formats"
     *    section.
     * <dt>FrameSet</dt><dd>
     *    The Format attribute of a FrameSet axis is the same as that
     *    of its current Frame (as specified by the Current
     *    attribute). Note that the syntax of the Format string is also
     *    determined by the current Frame.
     * <dt>TimeFrame</dt><dd>

     * If the format string starts with a percentage sign (%), then the 
     * whole format string is assumed to conform to the syntax defined by
     * the Frame class, and the axis values is formated as a decimal
     * radians value.
     * <h4>TimeFrame Formats</h4>
     * The Format string supplied for a TimeFrame should either use the
     * syntax defined by the base Frame class (i.e. a C "printf" format
     * string), or the extended "iso" syntax described below (the default
     * value is inherited from the Frame class):
     * <p>
     * <br> - C "printf" syntax: If the Format string is a C "printf" format
     * description such as "%1.7G", the TimeFrame axis value will be
     * formatted without change as a floating point value using this format.
     * The formatted string will thus represent an offset from the zero point 
     * specified by the TimeFrame's TimeOrigin attribute, measured in
     * units given by the TimeFrame's Unit attribute.
     * <p>
     * <br> - "iso" syntax: This is used to format a TimeFrame axis value as a
     * Gregorian date followed by an optional time of day. If the Format
     * value commences with the string "iso" then the TimeFrame axis value
     * will be converted to an absolute MJD, including the addition of the 
     * current TimeOrigin value, and then formatted as a Gregorian date 
     * using the format "yyyy-mm-dd". Optionally, the Format value may
     * include an integer precision following the "iso" specification (e.g. 
     * "iso.2"), in which case the time of day will be appended to the 
     * formatted date (if no time of day is included, the date field is
     * rounded to the nearest day). The integer value in the Format string 
     * indicates the number of decimal places to use in the seconds field. For 
     * instance, a Format value of "iso.0" produces a time of day of the form 
     * "hh:mm:ss", and a Format value of "iso.2" produces a time of day of the 
     * form "hh:mm:ss.ss". The date and time fields will be separated by a 
     * space. The value of the Digits attribute is ignored when using this 
     * "iso" format. 
     * <h4>Notes</h4>
     * <br> - When specifying this attribute by name, it should be
     * subscripted with the number of the Frame axis to which it
     * applies.
     * <h4>Class Applicability</h4>
     * <dl>
     * <dt>Frame</dt><dd>
     *    The Frame class interprets this attribute as a format
     *    specification string to be passed to the C "printf" function
     *    (e.g. "%1.7G") in order to format a single coordinate value
     *    (supplied as a double precision number).
     * <p>
     *    When supplying a value for this attribute, beware that the
     *    "%" character may be interpreted directly as a format
     *    specification by some printf-like functions (such as
     *    astSet). You may need to double it (i.e. use "%%") to avoid
     *    this.
     * <dt>SkyFrame</dt><dd>
     *    The SkyFrame class re-defines the syntax and default value of
     *    the Format string to allow the formatting of sexagesimal
     *    values as appropriate for the particular celestial coordinate
     *    system being represented. The syntax of SkyFrame Format
     *    strings is described (below) in the "SkyFrame Formats"
     *    section.
     * <dt>FrameSet</dt><dd>
     *    The Format attribute of a FrameSet axis is the same as that
     *    of its current Frame (as specified by the Current
     *    attribute). Note that the syntax of the Format string is also
     *    determined by the current Frame.
     * <dt>TimeFrame</dt><dd>
     *    The TimeFrame class extends the syntax of the Format string to 
     *    allow the formatting of TimeFrame axis values as Gregorian calendar
     *    dates and times. The syntax of TimeFrame Format strings is described 
     *    (below) in the "TimeFrame Formats" section.

     *    or polar motion (however, a correction for diurnal aberattion is

     *    celestial coordinate systems, this system is right handed. Also,
     *    unlike other SkyFrame systems, the AzEl system is sensitive to
     *    the timescale in which the Epoch value is supplied. This is
     *    because of the gross diurnal rotation which this system undergoes,
     *    causing a small change in time to translate to a large rotation.
     *    When converting to or from an AzEl system, the Epoch value for
     *    both source and destination SkyFrames should be supplied in the 
     *    TDB timescale. The difference between TDB and TT is between 1
     *    and 2 milliseconds, and so a TT value can usually be supplied in

     *    or polar motion (however, a correction for diurnal aberattion is
     *    applied). Note, unlike most other
     *    celestial coordinate systems, this system is right handed. Also,
     *    unlike other SkyFrame systems, the AzEl system is sensitive to
     *    the timescale in which the Epoch value is supplied. This is
     *    because of the gross diurnal rotation which this system undergoes,
     *    causing a small change in time to translate to a large rotation.
     *    When converting to or from an AzEl system, the Epoch value for
     *    both source and destination SkyFrames should be supplied in the 
     *    TDB timescale. The difference between TDB and TT is between 1
     *    and 2 milliseconds, and so a TT value can usually be supplied in
