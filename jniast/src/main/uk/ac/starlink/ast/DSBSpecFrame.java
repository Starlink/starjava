/**
 * Java interface to the AST DSBSpecFrame class
 *  - dual sideband spectral coordinate system description. 
 * A DSBSpecFrame is a specialised form of SpecFrame which represents 
 * positions in a spectrum obtained using a dual sideband instrument.
 * Such an instrument produces a spectrum in which each point contains 
 * contributions from two distinctly different frequencies, one from
 * the "lower side band" (LSB) and one from the "upper side band" (USB). 
 * Corresponding LSB and USB frequencies are connected by the fact
 * that they are an equal distance on either side of a fixed central
 * frequency known as the "Local Oscillator" (LO) frequency.
 * <p>
 * When quoting a position within such a spectrum, it is necessary to
 * indicate whether the quoted position is the USB position or the 
 * corresponding LSB position. The SideBand attribute provides this
 * indication. Another option that the SideBand attribute provides is
 * to represent a spectral position by its topocentric offset from the 
 * LO frequency.
 * <p>
 * In practice, the LO frequency is specified by giving the distance
 * from the LO frequency to some "central" spectral position. Typically 
 * this central position is that of some interesting spectral feature. 
 * The distance from this central position to the LO frequency is known 
 * as the "intermediate frequency" (IF). The value supplied for IF can
 * be a signed value in order to indicate whether the LO frequency is
 * above or below the central position.
