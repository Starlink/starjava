/**
 * Java interface to the AST SkyFrame class
 *  - celestial coordinate system description. 
 * A SkyFrame is a specialised form of Frame which describes
 * celestial longitude/latitude coordinate systems. The particular
 * celestial coordinate system to be represented is specified by
 * setting the SkyFrame's System attribute (currently, the default
 * is ICRS) qualified, as necessary, by a mean Equinox value and/or
 * an Epoch.
 * <p>
 * For each of the supported celestial coordinate systems, a SkyFrame
 * can apply an optional shift of origin to create a coordinate system 
 * representing offsets within the celestial coordinate system from some 
 * specified reference point. This offset coordinate system can also be 
 * rotated to define new longitude and latitude axes. See attributes 
 * SkyRef, SkyRefIs, SkyRefP and AlignOffset.
 * <p>
 * All the coordinate values used by a SkyFrame are in
 * radians. These may be formatted in more conventional ways for
 * display by using astFormat.

     * <h4>Aligning SkyFrames with Offset Coordinate Systems</h4>
     * The offset coordinate system within a SkyFrame should normally be 
     * considered as a superficial "re-badging" of the axes of the coordinate 
     * system specified by the System attribute - it merely provides an 
     * alternative numerical "label" for each position in the System coordinate 
     * system. The SkyFrame retains full knowledge of the celestial coordinate 
     * system on which the offset coordinate system is based (given by the 
     * System attribute). For instance, the SkyFrame retains knowledge of the 
     * way that one celestial coordinate system may "drift" with respect to 
     * another over time. Normally, if you attempt to align two SkyFrames (e.g. 
     * using the astConvert or astFindFrame routine),
     * the effect of any offset coordinate system defined in either SkyFrame 
     * will be removed, resulting in alignment being performed in the
     * celestial coordinate system given by the AlignSystem attribute.
     * However, by setting the AlignOffset attribute ot a non-zero value, it

     * coordinate system defined by attributes SkyRef and SkyRefIs. If used, 
     * it should be set to hold the longitude and latitude of a point within 
     * the coordinate system specified by the System attribute. The offset 
     * coordinate system represented by the SkyFrame will then be rotated in 
     * order to put the position supplied for SkyRefP on the zero longitude 
     * meridian. This rotation is about an axis from the centre of the 
     * celestial sphere to the point specified by the SkyRef attribute. 
     * The default value for SkyRefP is usually the north pole (that is, a 
     * latitude of +90 degrees in the coordinate system specified by the System 
     * attribute). The exception to this is if the SkyRef attribute is
     * itself set to either the north or south pole. In these cases the
     * default for SkyRefP is the origin (that is, a (0,0) in the coordinate 
     * system specified by the System attribute).
     * <p>
     * If an integer axis index is included in the attribute name (e.g.
     * "SkyRefP(1)") then the attribute value should be supplied as a single 
     * floating point axis value, in radians, when setting a value for the
     * attribute, and will be returned in the same form when getting the value 
     * of the attribute. In this case the integer axis index should be "1"
     * or "2" (the values to use for longitude and latitue axes are
     * given by the LonAxis and LatAxis attributes).
     * <p>
     * If no axis index is included in the attribute name (e.g. "SkyRefP") then 
     * the attribute value should be supplied as a character string
     * containing two formatted axis values (an axis 1 value followed by a
     * comma, followed by an axis 2 value). The same form
     * will be used when getting the value of the attribute. 
     * <h4>Notes</h4>
     * <br> - If the position given by the SkyRef attribute defines the origin
     * of the offset coordinate system (that is, if the SkyRefIs attribute 
     * is set to "origin"), then there will in general be two orientations 
     * which will put the supplied SkyRefP position on the zero longitude
     * meridian. The orientation which is actually used is the one which
     * gives the SkyRefP position a positive latitude in the offset coordinate 
     * system (the other possible orientation would give the SkyRefP position 
     * a negative latitude).
     * <br> - An error will be reported if an attempt is made to use a 
     * SkyRefP value which is co-incident with SkyRef or with the point
     * diametrically opposite to SkyRef on the celestial sphere. The
     * reporting of this error is deferred until the SkyRef and SkyRefP 
     * attribute values are used within a calculation. 
     * <br> - If the System attribute of the SkyFrame is changed, any position
     * given for SkyRefP is transformed into the new System.
