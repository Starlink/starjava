<p>This package provides a set of classes which can be used to make lightweight
queries of an 
<a href="http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/RegistryInterface/20091104/"
   >RI 1.0</a>-compliant IVOA registry.
They are lightweight in two senses:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Few external libraries are required (see <b>Dependencies</b>
    section below)</li>
<li>A very small memory footprint is required for processing, since 
    returned resources are streamed and only those parts required are
    retained</li>
</ol>
<p>The way it works is basically:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Assemble a SOAP request, as XML</li>
<li>Send it to the SOAP endpoint of the registry</li>
<li>Stream the SOAP response through a SAX parser.
  <ul>
  <li>In case of SOAP error, throw an exception based on the response</li>
  <li>In case of success, stream the response body to a user-supplied
      SAX parser, which can create objects representing registry resources</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Take the user-generated resource objects and make them available to
    calling code.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>For an example of usage, see the source code of the 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.RegClientTest}
class, which allows you to make <b>Search</b> or <b>KeywordSearch</b> queries
from the command line (using the main method with the "<code>-help</code>"
flag will provide usage information).
The output is a rudimentary summary of resources and their associated 
capabilities matching the submitted query.
The code uses {@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.BasicRegistryClient}, 
which is a simple implementation of the more flexible 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.AbstractRegistryClient} class,
and represents registry resources by instances of the
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.BasicResource} and
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.BasicCapability} classes.
These classes provide more per-resource metadata than is printed by the
example program, but still a very limited amount.
</p>

<h2>Customisation</h2>

<p>If you wish to acquire more information about the returned resources
than is available from 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.BasicResource} and
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.BasicCapability}, you will need
to write your own SOAP response body SAX handler, and make it available by
writing a concrete subclass of the 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.AbstractRegistryClient} class.
You can write the SAX ContentHandler any way you like, but you can use the
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.BasicRegistryClient}
implementation as a template if you like.
</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>The classes in this package do not require Axis or any other SOAP client.
Its only dependency is on part of Ray Plante's
<a href="http://trac.us-vo.org/project/nvo/wiki/IVOARegistry"
   >IVOARegistry</a> library,
specifically the part which can convert ADQL/S to ADQL/X for use within
a registry <b>Search</b> request.  This is done within the
{@link uk.ac.starlink.registry.RegistryRequestFactory#adqlsSearch
                               RegistryRequestFactory.adqlsSearch} method.
If that method not required 
(for instance you are using the <b>KeywordSearch</b> operation instead,
or you can construct your own ADQL/X), then no external libraries,
beyond the J2SE5 itself, are required.
</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This is not an all-singing or all-dancing registry client.
The focus is on something which does a limited job fast and in a small
memory footprint.  Use of it will probably require customisation.
Anyone is free to use this code in any way they please.
I'm happy to provide assistance or advice if I can.
